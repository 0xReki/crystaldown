    I sit down and take a look at my character information.

    That's a very bare character window. It looks like there are no character levels. Currently, I
    have no traits but Menu, Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge and Infinite Storage. I
    guess those are my gaming interface. From reading the glossary entries of my races, I would have
    guessed I'd have some racial traits. So they didn't even choose those for me.

I sit down and take a look at my character information.

{% include character/window.md character="swift-1-4" %}

That's a very bare character window.
As I said before, there are no character levels.
Currently, I have no traits but Menu, Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge and Infinite Storage.
I have no titles or blessings.
I guess the Menu traits are functions in my gaming interface.
From reading the glossary entries of my races, I would have guessed I'd have some racial traits.
So they didn't even choose those for me.
But that just means I don't have any existing traits to consider when choosing my initial traits and skills.
So let's have a look at the racial traits I can choose from.

{:.interface}
> Book of Choice: Racial Trait
>
> Choose one racial trait from this fixed selection.

>

Neat!
Let's see.
Since I have four books, I can choose four of those.
To maximize my survival chances, I'm going with Accelerated Recovery, Feline Form, Quick Learner, and Lucky Devil.
Let's have a look at the regular traits I can choose from next.

{:.interface}
> Book of Choice: Trait
>
> Choose one trait from this fixed selection.
>
> - Adrenaline Rush: <br> boost increases speed when health is low
> - Appealing Charisma: <br> increases charisma by a big amount

>
> - Nimbleness: <br> increases agility
> - Nimble and Precise: <br> increases agility and dexterity
> ^
> - ⋮
> {:style="list-style-type: none;"}
>

I can choose two of these.
Again, to maximize my survival chances, I'm going with Appealing Charisma and Nimble & Precise.
The latter sound like a typical trait that thieves have, though in this day and age, you'd rather call them *specialists for spontaneous involuntary ownership transfer*.
I can't say I dislike the sound of the latter term.
Every job sounds better if it's called a specialist!
Let's have a look that the skill I can choose from.

{:.interface}
> Book of Choice: Skills
>
> Choose one skill to gain at level 1 from this fixed selection.
>
> ⋮
>
> {:.interface}
> > Meta-Skills
> > {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
> >
> > - Fighting Skills
> > - Magic Skills
> > - Production Skills
> > - Survival Skills
>

I quickly scroll over the categories to get an overview.
Meta-skills?
Wait a minute… I cancel the selection and try choosing a skill to master.

{:.interface}
> Book of Choice: Skill Mastery
>
> Choose one skill to gain at maximum level from this fixed selection.
>
> ⋮
>
> {:.interface}
> > Meta-Skills
> > {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
> >
> > - Fighting Skills
> > - Magic Skills
> > - Production Skills
> > - Survival Skills
>

I can choose two skills to master and it looks like I can master meta-skills.
I grin.
I guess I've found my cheat!
It'd been even better if I had chosen Mastery Obsession earlier…
I mean I finally get to live in an RPG world and completely forgot about min-maxing!
Something I tend to do.
I should have put more thought into that…
Well, It's no use crying over spilled juice!
So which ones do I choose?
Survival Skills sound good.
Let me check.

{:.interface}
> Book of Choice: Skill Mastery

> ⋮

> {:.interface}

> > - Camping
> > - Danger Sense

> > - Presence Detection
> > - Presence Isolation
> > - Trap Detection
> > - Trap Disarming
> > - Trap Setting
> > - Stealth
> > - Weakness Detection
>
> ⋮

For some reason, half of the skills in this skill tree sound like thief skills.
Anyway, I'll go with that.
I think I'm good with survival chances, so I should be choosing some other skills as well.
Magic sounds nice.

Now that I've spent my skill masteries, I spend the remaining books to get all fighting and production skills at level one.
I should take a look at my character window now.

{% include character/window.md character="swift-1-5" %}

What's this?
While most of the maximum level skills are level {% include ruby base="X" text="ten"%}, some of those skills are level {% include ruby base="E" text="eleven"%}.
My guess is one of my traits increases the skill level limit on those.

I have magic skills now, plus I have the Camping skill on level {% include ruby base="X" text="ten"%}.
I should try making a campfire.
I should be able to build a campfire using magic.
But I still don't have any idea how to do it.
I don't know even how to use magic at all…
Let's try it, anyway, creating a stone frame… I touch the ground.
A certain phrase comes to my mind.

*“Compaction!”*

A cloud of sand forms in the shape of a ring around where I touch the ground.
I feel it'd too small and shallow for a campfire if that sand were to compact to stone.
So I imagine a slightly bigger and higher stone frame.
The ring changes size and the sand slowly compacts to stone.
Yeah, this looks like the stone frame of a typical campfire.
Is it done?
No, something in my mind tells me it's not.
So I keep at it.
After I get the feeling it's finally done, I stop and put in some wood.

Now I need to light it.
I could just ignite the wood directly.
What could go wrong?
I put my hands over the wood and imagine fire: hot and blazing.
I mutter the word that suddenly comes into my mind.

*“Blaze!”*

Oh! I get startled and flinch.
Good thing I do.
The next moment I see a flash and all the wood I put in has combusted.
The smell of burnt wood fills the air.
That was dangerous!
I should be more careful.
Let's try again.
I put in some more wood.
This time I put in some tinder as well.
I should light it carefully.
I put my hand over the tinder and imagine it smouldering.

*“Smoulder!”*

After a while, it starts glowing and smoking.
Now, I can either fan it until it turns into a fire or I pour more energy into it until it turns into a fire.
Let's do the latter.
I imagine slowly putting in more energy into the smouldering.
It intensifies.
The wood also starts smouldering on the place where it touches.
After spreading for a while, it starts burning.
Neat, I have made fire!
I sit down and admire my creation.
It was surprisingly difficult.
Good thing I started early.

Due to the mishap just now, I'm almost out of wood.
I need to gather more.
I go back into the forest and gather lumber.
I can't help but notice the animals in the forest now, I guess it must be because of to the skills I gained.
Since I'm not feeling any danger from them I ignore them for now.
I like the atmosphere of this forest.
Maybe I should settle down here!
The cliff where my tent currently is seems to be a good place to dig a cave.
Let's do that tomorrow!
