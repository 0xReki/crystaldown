The sun is about to set.
Let's do some experiments with my Infinite Storage skill.
I know I can store quite an amount of sand in it.
I also know I can store things without touching them.
When I look at my Infinite Storage window, there's no indication I have a limit of any kind: even though I have a lot of sand, it doesn't even split into multiple stacks as I would expect.

I put one of my cups on the table and move several steps away.
I try to store the cup.
It doesn't work.
I get closer and try again until it works.
It looks like the range for storing things is about three to four steps.

Next, I try storing a burning stick.
A few minutes later, I take it out.
It immediately starts burning again.
So I guess putting things into Infinite Storage freezes time on them.
That's great!
I don't need to fuss about preserving food.

Next, I try storing the fire itself.
I do get the feedback storing something.
I try releasing it somewhere else.
I see some flickering where I released it.
So was it storing the agitated ions?

Can I store light?
Yeah, it looks like I can.
But just as with storing fire, I can't see any use for that.
I can just create Fire and Light with magic.
Although, I think I could extinguish a forest fire by storing away the burning trees.
Nah, that's a terrible idea.
If I take them out again, I have burning trees.

I try storing Raiden.
It doesn't work.
I guess I can't store living things.

What about the Awakening Crystals on top of the cliff?
I walk up to the place.
It's quite a nice sight: those crystals glow in the dark.
No, glowing is the wrong word.
They shine, they're bright enough to light the area.
I see a white shining crystal.
I analyze it.

I already have that skill.
But I try storing it, anyway.
Oh, It works!!
I can bring this one to my cave and use it as a light source!
On the way back, I see several tiny glowing crystals standing in steaming water.
Unlike the other crystals, these radiate magic.
I analyze them.

Upon reading the description, I store all the Continuous Magic Crystals.
I'm hoping to upgrade my bathroom with them.
I won't be able to do it today.
But putting them in my Infinite Storage and leaving them there isn't a problem.

My Infinite Storage isn't full, but it looks quite messy.
Can I sort my Infinite Storage?
Oh, I can add folders! And sub-folders!
That's great!
So I add several folders to keep my Infinite Storage organized.

After arriving in my cave.
I dig out a hole in the wall of the living room and put the Awakening Crystal of Light Magic in the hole.
I create a sliding door to cover the crystal to switch the light off.
This works better than I expected!
