Before I return to my cave, I drop by the drainage to inspect the area.
It doesn't smell at all — that's great.
That means the Slimes do a good job of cleaning up.
The Slimes come out to greet me.

I notice some of the Slimes have a different colour.
They are blood red. I analyze them.

Blood Slimes?
That means I can just keep them in the kitchen and feed them the blood directly!
I take them with me to the cave.
When I enter the cave, I notice some strange blob on the kitchen table.
I let the Blood Slimes eat their fill of blood while I analyze the blob on the table.

Slime Gelatine? It's gelatine!
I can make fruit jelly! With this… and gummy bears!
But I need more than this.
What do I need to feed the Slimes to get more jelly?! As if to answer my question one of the Slimes crawls on the table and eats part of the animal fat I set aside and forgot to put away.

“So you Slimes make jelly from animal fat?” I ask the Slime.
Not that it would answer me.
It just simply continues to happily eat the fat.

Excited, I put more animal fat on the table.
I do have quite the amount in my Infinite Storage.
I call the Slimes that live in the cave.

*«If you like Animal Fat, you guys can have it.»*

Some Slimes come to the kitchen to enjoy the fat.
While those eat, I decide to check the Slimes that enjoy the bathtub.
They've become translucent with very fluid liquid inside them.
So those have evolved as well?

I feel like I should have given the Slimes more attention…
My guess is Slimes evolve depending on their diet.
I wonder what kinds of Slimes and other Slime products I can get…
Let's add it to the bucket list.
The next day,
I have more than enough gelatine.
Let's try making gummy bears.
Why gummy bears?
I like wine gums, but I should start simple with just gummy bears.
I mush Tarries and sieve them.
Then I boil the juice to thicken it.
After I lost about 30% of the water I let the juice cool down a just a little.
While it's still hot but not boiling, I put in some Jelly blobs.
I stir the mixture until it's homogenous and pour it into bear-shaped ice cube trays I made from glass.
I then let it cool down completely.

I need to make some kind of fridge.
Not to store stuff, I can use my Infinite Storage for that.
I need it for cooling things!
I take another note in my memos: “build a fridge”.

Later, I check the results.
The bad news is it doesn't have the consistency of gummy bears.
The good news is it ended up becoming fruit jelly, so it's not a complete failure.
I guess to get gummy bear consistency, I need to boil the juice down even more.
Let's put it into my Infinite Storage for now.
