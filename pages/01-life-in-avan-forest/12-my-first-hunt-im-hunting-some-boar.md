The next day, I decide to go hunting for the first time.
I use a Choice Box of Weapons and get a bow.
Luckily, a quiver of arrows was included.
I have Raiden show me a place I can go hunt.
I lie in wait in the bushes.
There's nothing here.

*«Raiden, are you sure this is a good hunting spot?»*

Raider lands near me and waits.
After a while, I see several boars come by.
I knock an arrow and aim.
And shoot. One of the boar shrieks. I smile — I've hit one.

Suddenly, I get a nasty feeling of cold.
I know that feeling — I better leg it.
While running away, I look back.
The boar I just shot is chasing me.
I barely even managed to land a hit, so it's alive and angry.
I need a way to stop it, and I need it fast.
Is there a spell I can use?
No, using fire spells would be a very bad idea.
Can I make a pitfall?
I stretch my hand towards the boar.

*“Displace Earth!”*

The ground where the boar is about to step suddenly moves downwards and the boar falls into the resulting hole.
I hear the impact.
Did it die?
I send Raiden down to check.
I can hear the boar shrieking.
Raiden comes back.

I get closer to the edge and aim again.
I see a smoky silver string connecting my arrow to the boar.
Just what is that?!
Even as the boar is moving, the string is stuck to it.
I take a closer look at where the string is connecting to the boar.
The colour of the skin is different there.
Is it a weak point?

To test that out, I carefully aim at that point.
I shoot.
I hear another shriek.
And something dropping to the ground.
Did it die?
Even if it didn’t, I now know where its weakness is.
So that's how my Weakness Detection skill works?
Again, I send Raiden down to check.

Judging from the feeling of Raiden calling me over, I think it's finally dead.
I raise the ground.
Yes, it's dead.
I put the dead boar into my Infinite Storage.
Phew!
That was more excitement than I wanted.
I should practice more.

I return to my cave and hang the boar in the kitchen.
I drain the boar's blood and use the same bucket from yesterday.
Unexpectedly, the blood in the bucket seems still fresh!
Is that an effect of my Infinite Storage?
I need to experiment with by Infinite Storage later!

Since I still have time until I need to make food, I start making a map of the forest.
I use some herbs and fruits I got yesterday to make colours and draw the places I have already visited on the table of my living room.
Of course, I mark the river blue.
I mark the orchard where I gathered the fruits green.
Finally, I mark the area where I was just hunting in pink.
To make sure the colours stay as they are, I seal those parts of the table with glass.

After I'm done, I go to the kitchen and dismantle the boar I killed.
Today, I'm making soup.
Having some bread or rice would be nice…
With the boar, I should have enough food for several days.
With the soup done, I scoop the portions for the day and put the rest into my Infinite Storage.
