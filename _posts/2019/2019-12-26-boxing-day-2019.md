In Bavaria, where I grew up, there is a peculiar Christmas tradition: when you visit your friend's place between Boxing Day and Epiphany (sixth of January) you overly praise the Christmas Tree.
The host then has to give you a glass of alcohol in return.
Not having one doesn't help since it's allowed to bring your own Christmas Tree.

That being said, here's a Christmas Tree: ðŸŽ„

It's so beautiful!
The green colour!
The decorations!
The lighting!
It's so perfect!
