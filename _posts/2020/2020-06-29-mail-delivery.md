title: "Mail Delivery"

Mail… The gist is you wait all day and it always gets delivered in the five minutes you're away.
So you need to get to the depot and retrieve it the day after.

Or… you live in a flatshare and because both of our names are on the door, the mail company mandated them not to deliver parcels addressed to just one of us.
Just for the off chance, it's a person that happens to have our names combined as their name.

What did you guys smoke?!
