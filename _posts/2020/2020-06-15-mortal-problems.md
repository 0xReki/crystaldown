Taxes, Reforms etc. Some things seem to have changed and starting in July, Patreon needs to put VAT on the pledges from some more countries.
At least, that's what I understand from the loads of mails I got from Patreon, telling me to tell my Patrons about it.

I have to be honest, I still feel it's like an intransparent mess to see prices without VAT.
Fast Food restaurants in Germany are quite good at managing that.
There's 7% on takeout, but 19% on eating in-house.
It doesn't matter you always pay the same.
I guess that's the European idea of transparency?
What do you guys think?

Anyway, stay healthy and enjoy the chapter.

{% assign page = site.pages
  | where: "type", "chapter"
  | where: "book.series", "Crystal Down"
  | where: "book.number", 1
  | where: "chapter", 47
  | first %}

[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url | absolute_url }}){:.btn .btn-block .btn-primary .btn-lg}

EDIT 2020-06-16: I fixed the broken layout. Sometimes, technology just sucks.
