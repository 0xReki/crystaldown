title: "Who am I kiddingâ€¦"

You may have noticed I haven't posted a new Crystal Down chapter for a long time.
The way the story developed wasn't doing me any favours.
Rather than just leaving it in hiatus for too long, I've decided to drop it for real.
I may possibly pick up the story in the future again.
But as a discovery type writer I have discovered writing LitRPG is not for me.

But just in case, you're inclined to pick up the pieces and continue the story without me: feel free to do so.
Just get in touch so I know about it. :3
