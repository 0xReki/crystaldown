title: "Happy New Year 2021"
---
I'm sorry it took so long, but this chapter took like forever to write. I'm scraping on the bottom of the barrel. I don't want to give up writing on this story, but continuing is a little hard. I will try my best to come up with something that gets to all the other stuff I've planned.

Anyway, I wish you a Happy New Year! Stay healthy, stay safe.

Let's all hope 2021 is going to be better.

PS: There will be a new story coming out in 2021. Of course, Patrons will be able to read it one week ahead. In fact it should be on Patreon  when this chapter goes live to the general public.
