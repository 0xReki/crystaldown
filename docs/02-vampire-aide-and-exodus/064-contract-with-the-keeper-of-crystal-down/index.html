current situation would be opposite to that‚Ä¶‚Äù, I add.‚ÄÇThis means‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCorrect.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve even received an oracle about this.‚ÄÇThe terms they set are clear and concise: I am only allowed to help you if you become my aide.‚Äù Becoming his aide? ‚ÄúThen that means‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it means you will have to leave Matt‚Äôs side and start living in Avan Forest with me.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm sorry, this is something that has been dictated to me.‚ÄÇThey even stated I can‚Äôt help you with getting out of that encirclement of running water in the case you refuse.‚Äù It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre saying I don‚Äôt have any other choice but to become Swift‚Äôs retainer.‚ÄÇSwift has an expression of self-loathing on his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be frank here,‚Äù Sain interjects, ‚Äúfrom what I see, you‚Äôre left with either trying to deal with this yourself and possibly being banned from ever getting near Prince Matthew again.‚ÄÇOr you leave his side and get to meet him from time to time.‚Äù I know Sain is right, it basically boils down to that.‚ÄÇLogically, becoming Swift‚Äôs aide is the only choice. But I don‚Äôt like the prospect of abandoning my post. ‚ÄúOh,¬†a message from Matt!‚Äù Swift opens his message bottle and takes out the piece of paper and looks at it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for you,‚Äù he jumps over to me and hands the paper to me. It‚Äôs Matt‚Äôs handwriting. I have been notified of the oracle regarding your fate. Thus, I, Matthew Sitnalta, second prince of Sitnalta, relieve you, Patrick Boots, of your duties as my aide. Thank you for your service.‚ÄÇI pray for your recovery, my friend. An official announcement will be made later or when I have found a suitable replacement for you. This is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSwift‚Ä¶ Matt‚Ä¶ this was supposed to be a choice for me to make.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt just shows how much we care about your well-being.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, since I‚Äôve been relieved of my duties.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm left with no other choice but to accept and become your aide.‚Äù I extend a hand towards Swift.‚ÄÇHe shakes my hand.‚ÄÇHe closes his eyes for a while and mumbles. ‚ÄúYou shall not consume other blood than mine! Forced Compulsion! Envassal!‚Ä¶‚Äù I can see something‚Ä¶ what is that?‚ÄÇSwift continues mumbling, but I can‚Äôt understand him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain later.‚ÄÇFor now, use these Awakening Crystals,‚Äù Swift produces several crystals from his Infinite Storage. Two of them have a white glow. One other one has a sapphire-blue glow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving then,‚Äù Sain says. ‚ÄúAre you sure? It‚Äôs quite late,‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about me.‚ÄÇThe route back to Tatilans is quite safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†right‚Ä¶ I got careless.‚ÄÇYou heard nothing!‚Äù Swift asks. ‚ÄúYes,¬†I heard nothing.‚ÄÇTo keep it that way, I need to leave!‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand, please don‚Äôt take it personally, I can‚Äôt escort you out.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it,‚Äù Sain turns to me, ‚ÄúI pray for your recovery. Bye!‚Äù He hurriedly leaves. I touch the crystals one after the other.‚ÄÇEach one shines brightly for a moment before turning transparent. ‚ÄúThis should do for now.‚ÄÇSince Sain is gone, we can talk about everything.‚ÄÇBut let‚Äôs get into my‚Ä¶, I mean, our cave first.‚ÄÇDisplace Earth!‚Äù The rising earth interrupts the flow of water.‚ÄÇI can finally get out.‚ÄÇWe leave the Magic Space. ‚ÄúYou used some rare spells‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I did.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt know why, but the gods insisted on me using the Forced Compulsion Spell to only allow my blood in case your need for blood ever surfaces.‚ÄÇI believe Monster Blood should be a suitable source of Mana, too.‚ÄÇBut then, that may just be the price for helping you‚Ä¶ The other spell is a contract for me sharing some of my Traits with you.‚ÄÇYou should have something new added in your vision.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I can see it.‚ÄÇWhat is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the manifestation of a hidden Trait called Menu.‚Äù ‚ÄúMenu?! That‚Äôs a trait only summoned heroes are supposed to have!‚ÄÇAre you a summoned hero?‚ÄÇI have become a hero‚Äôs retainer?!‚Äù I knew Swift was special, but I didn‚Äôt imagine this special!‚ÄÇBut it all makes sense.‚ÄÇHis almost limitless Mana‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAnd him not knowing what‚Äôs normal‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a hero.‚ÄÇOr have you ever heard of a hero that holes up in a forest?‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúOK, I do admit I was reincarnated into this world.‚ÄÇWhile I‚Äôm quite sure that disqualifies me as a summoned hero I‚Äôd be quite happy if nobody were to learn about that.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†it‚Äôd be better to keep that fact hidden.‚ÄÇBut will you ever tell Prince Matthew about it?‚Äù ‚ÄúAt some point, I definitely will.‚ÄÇNow just isn‚Äôt a good time.‚ÄÇBack to the trait: Menu is just a basic framework for other traits.‚ÄÇSome of our other traits like Mystic Eyes of Analysis and Cavern Navigation have integrated with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúMystic Eyes of Analysis? Cavern Navigation?‚Äù ‚ÄúMystic Eyes of Analysis was in the blue Awakening Crystal.‚ÄÇI was just looking for a trait that would turn your eyes back to a blue colour.‚ÄÇIt just happened to be the Mystic Eyes of Analysis.‚Äù ‚ÄúSome people would sell their soul for this trait and you just give it to me so I can have blue eyes again?!‚Äù Swift giggles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my retainer now.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no need to hold back.‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 64: The Contract with Keeper of the Crystal Down, Patrick"> The Contract with Keeper of the Crystal Down </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-10-12, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/jayfeather#2293" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">jayfeather</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Inside Swift's Evergreen Forest" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/02-vampire-aide-and-exodus/063-inside-swifts-evergreen-forest/">Inside Swift's Evergreen Forest</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Banter About Skills" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/02-vampire-aide-and-exodus/065-banter-about-skills/">Banter About Skills</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>‚ÄúWelcome back!‚Äù Sain greets Swift.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean it‚Äôs not so easy?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúI found everything I needed but‚Ä¶‚Äù, Swift sighs, ‚Äúas you know, I‚Äôm the Keeper of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm sworn to political neutrality.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd helping me in the current situation would be opposite to that‚Ä¶‚Äù, I add.‚ÄÇThis means‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúCorrect.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve even received an oracle about this.‚ÄÇThe terms they set are clear and concise: I am only allowed to help you if you become my aide.‚Äù</p> <p>Becoming his aide?</p> <p>‚ÄúThen that means‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it means you will have to leave Matt‚Äôs side and start living in Avan Forest with me.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm sorry, this is something that has been dictated to me.‚ÄÇThey even stated I can‚Äôt help you with getting out of that encirclement of running water in the case you refuse.‚Äù</p> <p>It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre saying I don‚Äôt have any other choice but to become Swift‚Äôs retainer.‚ÄÇSwift has an expression of self-loathing on his face.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll be frank here,‚Äù Sain interjects, ‚Äúfrom what I see, you‚Äôre left with either trying to deal with this yourself and possibly being banned from ever getting near Prince Matthew again.‚ÄÇOr you leave his side and get to meet him from time to time.‚Äù</p> <p>I know Sain is right, it basically boils down to that.‚ÄÇLogically, becoming Swift‚Äôs aide is the only choice.

Cavern Navigation?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúMystic Eyes of Analysis was in the blue Awakening Crystal.‚ÄÇI was just looking for a trait that would turn your eyes back to a blue colour.‚ÄÇIt just happened to be the Mystic Eyes of Analysis.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSome people would sell their soul for this trait and you just give it to me so I can have blue eyes again?!‚Äù</p> <p>Swift giggles.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my retainer now.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no need to hold back.‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Inside Swift's Evergreen Forest" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/02-vampire-aide-and-exodus/063-inside-swifts-evergreen-forest/">Inside Swift's Evergreen Forest</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Banter About Skills" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/02-vampire-aide-and-exodus/065-banter-about-skills/">Banter About Skills</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
