About five minutes later, she has actually tracked down a boar.‚ÄÇNow I finally notice she doesn‚Äôt have any weapons with her.‚ÄÇShe only has something that looks like a guitar. She charges towards the boar while grabbing her guitar at the neck. ‚ÄúMusical Strike!‚Äù She hits the boar on its head with the guitar.‚ÄÇThe boar immediately falls down.‚ÄÇShe has just beheaded the boar with that one hit!‚ÄÇContrary to my expectation, the guitar is still in one piece. ‚ÄúWha‚Ä¶ what was that?!‚Äù I stutter. ‚ÄúMusical Strike? It‚Äôs a bard technique.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ Is that how bards usually fight?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, this is my version of it.‚ÄÇUsually, my master used her instrument to launch arrows with that technique.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôm no good with shooting arrows, so I just give them a smack with my trusty mandolin instead.‚ÄÇThe technique hardens the mandolin and its strings so they don‚Äôt break.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt know about other bards.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never talked to other bards but my master.‚ÄÇThey are all my competitors.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt care much about what they do.‚ÄÇI have my own style.‚ÄÇIn both music and fighting.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can bring this home to your family.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks, but actually, I live by myself in the forest.‚ÄÇ‚Äìy name is Swift, Swift Mittens.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lecarvi, Lecarvi the Bard.‚ÄÇYou do? Isn‚Äôt that dangerous?‚ÄÇLiving alone in the forest?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot really, I have a safe place.‚ÄÇAnd I can take care of myself.‚ÄÇI do go to the capital from time to time to trade.‚ÄÇThat maple sap you annihilated is the basis for a product I manufacture.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry.

That‚Äôs a strange thing to make of it. Why not ale?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have Huffin for that.‚Äù ‚ÄúHuffin?‚ÄÇYes,¬†you can use that, but you can use something else, too.‚ÄÇToo bad I can‚Äôt remember what it was.‚ÄÇI should have listened to what my mother taught me.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo there is something else I can use for making ale?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†there is. Now I vaguely remember something.‚ÄÇBunnyflies love that stuff.‚ÄÇYou just need to dissolve it in water, there‚Äôs no need to process it like Huffin.‚Äù I remember the taste of the Feno fern.‚ÄÇYes,¬†now I know what it reminded me of.‚ÄÇLike she‚Äôs just said, I can use that as a replacement for Huffin! ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúthanks for hunting this.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll take it.‚ÄÇSince I don‚Äôt have any business in this part of the forest anymore, I‚Äôll just go home then. Goodbye!‚Äù Before she can answer I jump on top of a tree and move away.‚ÄÇIn case she can somewhat track me with her trait, I take a detour before getting home.‚ÄÇI think that‚Äôs should be enough to shake her off.‚ÄÇArriving at home, I grind one or two Feno leaves and open my last bottle of maple wine and in the Feno powder.‚ÄÇI then close the bottle again.‚ÄÇIf this turns my wine into ale I should be done right?‚ÄÇI analyze the bottle. Maple Ale (Young) This ale hasn‚Äôt developed its beery taste yet. I‚Äôm quite sure this is not how you make ale.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve got no idea how it works.‚ÄÇBut if this is all to make ale, I‚Äôll just do it this way.‚ÄÇSince my plans of making more wine were foiled, I spend the rest of the day with getting some soil and fertilizer into my Magic Space.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 46: Enter Lecarvi the Bard"> Enter Lecarvi the Bard </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-05-25, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/jayfeather#2293" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">jayfeather</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Divine Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/45-divine-problems/">Divine Problems Transcending Realms</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Mortal Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/47-mortal-problems/">Mortal Problems Transcending Realms</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>After Matt and the others left the forest, I take a walk to the southern part of the forest.‚ÄÇI want to make a new batch of Maple Wine before I go on the next trip to the capital.‚ÄÇI look for the tree I‚Äôve tapped for maple sap.‚ÄÇAfter walking around for a half a bell, I finally find the tree.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs not only the tree I find.</p> <p>There‚Äôs a female Kouniklanthrope sitting there drinking the sap from a horn.‚ÄÇShe has a flower bud in her hair.‚ÄÇEven though I‚Äôm in hiding as always it seems as she has noticed me approaching.‚ÄÇSee adjusts her ears towards my direction.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôm basically moving silently!!‚ÄÇShe shouldn‚Äôt be able to pick up my presence.</p> <p>‚ÄúGood morning!‚Äù she calmly says, ‚Äúdid those belong to you?‚ÄÇIt smelled so tasty I simply couldn‚Äôt help myself.‚Äù</p> <p>I show myself.‚ÄÇShe jumps a little in surprise.‚ÄÇSo does she have some skill or trait just like Matt that gives her the ability to guess by presence?‚ÄÇI mean, she was still surprised by me showing myself‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúGood morning.‚ÄÇYes,¬†that was mine‚Ä¶‚ÄÇIt shouldn‚Äôt matter that much if you just took a little.‚Äù</p> <p>I quickly get a glance of her character info.</p> <blockquote class="interface " style="order: 20"> <p onclick="toggleAccordion(this)" class="inactive">Character Info</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Name: <td>Lecarvi Sylvilagus <tr> <td>Age: <td>23 <tr> <td>Species: <td>Kouniklanthrope/Anthodryad </table> <blockquote class="interface"> <p onclick="toggleAccordion(this)" class="inactive">Titles &amp;

That‚Äôs a strange thing to make of it. Why not ale?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have Huffin for that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHuffin?‚ÄÇYes,¬†you can use that, but you can use something else, too.‚ÄÇToo bad I can‚Äôt remember what it was.‚ÄÇI should have listened to what my mother taught me.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo there is something else I can use for making ale?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†there is. Now I vaguely remember something.‚ÄÇBunnyflies love that stuff.‚ÄÇYou just need to dissolve it in water, there‚Äôs no need to process it like Huffin.‚Äù</p> <p>I remember the taste of the Feno fern.‚ÄÇYes,¬†now I know what it reminded me of.‚ÄÇLike she‚Äôs just said, I can use that as a replacement for Huffin!</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúthanks for hunting this.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll take it.‚ÄÇSince I don‚Äôt have any business in this part of the forest anymore, I‚Äôll just go home then. Goodbye!‚Äù</p> <p>Before she can answer I jump on top of a tree and move away.‚ÄÇIn case she can somewhat track me with her trait, I take a detour before getting home.‚ÄÇI think that‚Äôs should be enough to shake her off.‚ÄÇArriving at home, I grind one or two Feno leaves and open my last bottle of maple wine and in the Feno powder.‚ÄÇI then close the bottle again.‚ÄÇIf this turns my wine into ale I should be done right?‚ÄÇI analyze the bottle.</p> <blockquote class="interface"> <p>Maple Ale (Young)</p> <p>This ale hasn‚Äôt developed its beery taste yet.</p> </blockquote> <p>I‚Äôm quite sure this is not how you make ale.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve got no idea how it works.‚ÄÇBut if this is all to make ale, I‚Äôll just do it this way.‚ÄÇSince my plans of making more wine were foiled, I spend the rest of the day with getting some soil and fertilizer into my Magic Space.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Divine Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/45-divine-problems/">Divine Problems Transcending Realms</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Mortal Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/47-mortal-problems/">Mortal Problems Transcending Realms</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="author noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
