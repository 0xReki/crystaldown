That‚Äôs a rare gift!‚ÄÇBut it also makes my job easier. But you must be tired of being kept in the dark!‚ÄÇLet me explain: it‚Äôs a common tradition to make a good luck item for people finishing their first subjugation.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs commonly made from the monster they killed.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù I answer. I hand the items to the dwarf. Examines it for a while. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ This is Giant Rabbit hide! Is this the one the oracle was about?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it is,‚Äù Seth answers. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù the Dwarf turns to me, ‚Äúsince I already know Matt‚Äôs size, I only need to take your sizes.‚Äù He leads me into a room and measures me.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs taking quite a while which I find unusual.‚ÄÇBut eventually, he finishes. I get dressed and get back to the front. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ suggestion,‚Äù I hear Matt say.‚ÄÇHe sees me coming and acts as if nothing has happened.‚ÄÇI feel like I have caught a hint of some surprise I‚Äôm going to get.‚ÄÇI should play along and feign ignorance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take about two weeks,‚Äù the Dwarf says. ‚ÄúSee you in two weeks. Have a nice day!‚Äù Matt says. He sees us off and we leave the store. ‚ÄúTime to go to the Adventurers‚Äô Guild!‚Äù Seth says. We arrive at a building that looks like a bar, the sign outside has a quill on it.‚ÄÇWe enter the building.‚ÄÇFrom the inside, it also looks like a bar.‚ÄÇUnlike a regular bar, however, there is a prominent office area with boards and counters. It‚Äôs the late afternoon, so the guild is somewhat filled but still mostly empty.‚ÄÇMost of the adventurers stand in front of the bulletin boards.‚ÄÇThe pin boards seem to be colour-coded.‚ÄÇThe clerk is sitting on the table.‚ÄÇShe has bunny ears.‚ÄÇShe wears a pink cap with feathers attached to it.‚ÄÇSee sees us coming in and waves at us to greet us. ‚ÄúWelcome to the Adventurers‚Äô Guild. What can I do for you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to register as adventurers,‚Äù Matt answers. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù she get off the counter, ‚Äúplease fill out these forms. Do you need an amanuensis?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†I don‚Äôt,‚Äù Matt says. ‚ÄúYes,¬†please!‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù she pulls a feather from her hat and hands it to Matt with a form.‚ÄÇSo the feathers on her hat were actually quills!‚ÄÇShe gets another form and starts asking questions. ‚ÄúCan I have your name please?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, my name is Swift Mittens.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently X () years old.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite young, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe guild master told us to come here.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh,¬†I see! I heard about it. Good job!‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo,¬†that‚Äôs all the required information.‚ÄÇThe other information is not required.‚ÄÇBut some info about your specialization is recommended.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I give ‚Äòintelligence specialist‚Äô as specialization?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs not a problem.‚ÄÇIt just has to describe your abilities without revealing your hand too much.‚ÄÇWith this, we‚Äôre done with the registration.‚Äù Matt hands her his form. ‚ÄúThank you. Since you‚Äôre all underage, you‚Äôd usually need to pass a battle assessment.‚ÄÇBut with the guild master‚Äôs authorization, you‚Äôre exempt from that.‚Äù She put two translucent cards on the counter. ‚ÄúI need a drop of blood on those cards to attune these cards to you.‚Äù She gives us a needle each. I poke in my left index finger and let a drop fall on the card.‚ÄÇThe card shines for a brief moment and turns red copper. ‚ÄúBy the way, I‚Äôm Lynette Taru, a Kouniklanthrope.‚ÄÇSince you‚Äôre just registering for formalities, I will just explain how Guild Cards work: the have your name, your party affiliation, and your specialization on it.‚ÄÇThe colour of the card is your current rank.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôre currently bronze rank.‚ÄÇThese cards can also serve as your identification.‚ÄÇPlease don‚Äôt lose those!‚ÄÇReissuing them costs money depending on your rank but at least one Gold Coin.‚Äù ‚ÄúIdentification?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she picks up my card, ‚Äúif someone who‚Äôs not their owner holds the card for more than X () seconds it turns translucent.‚Äù Just as she says it, the card turns completely translucent. She gives me my card back. ‚ÄúBut if you get it back, it will become the correct colour again.‚Äù And it does turn back to bronze. ‚ÄúCan I have your cards for a minute to record your feat?‚ÄÇAlso, I‚Äôll make a note on your cards so you‚Äôll get your full orienteering when you actually start adventuring.‚Äù I give her my card and she put it into recess on her side of the counter.‚ÄÇThen, she taps a metal plate on her counter and letters appear on the plate as if that plate were a tablet!‚ÄÇI wonder how it works‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAfter tinkering a while, she gives me back my card.‚ÄÇI put it into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇAnd repeats the same procedure with Matt‚Äôs card.‚ÄÇSince we‚Äôre done here, we leave the building. Matt‚Äôs group escorts me to the western gate. ‚ÄúThanks for taking me along.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to have you. Will you find you way back?‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll manage. Goodbye, until next time.‚Äù ‚ÄúUntil next time.‚Äù I show my guild card to the guard and make my way towards the forest.‚ÄÇWhen I‚Äôm far enough from the city the Bunnyflies make themselves visible again.‚ÄÇWhen we arrive at the cave, I pour the Bunnyflies another bowl of maple wine. ¬´I hope you weren‚Äôt too bored.¬ª It‚Äôs already dark outside, but it‚Äôs still early so I figure I should try experimenting some more.‚ÄÇI should try getting the hang of the Feline Form transformation. I close my eyes and I imagine turning into a cat.‚ÄÇWhen I open my eyes, I‚Äôm the height I was yesterday morning.‚ÄÇMy clothes have fallen off me.‚ÄÇCan I transform without closing my eyes?‚ÄÇI try. It works.‚ÄÇWithout bothering to get dressed, I try transforming into a cat while I jump on to my bed.‚ÄÇI can barely make it in time and my footing is slightly off, but it works.‚ÄÇTransforming is tiring‚Ä¶ I should just drop here on my bed‚Ä¶ and sleep‚Ä¶‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 30: Registration at the Adventurers' Guild"> Registration at the Adventurers' Guild </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-02-05, last updated on 2021-07-26 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/NotKeoni#1327" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">notKeoni</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" My First Trip to the Capital!" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/29-my-first-trip-to-the-capital/">My First Trip to the Capital!</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Sky Salmon and Sky Salmon Stew" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/31-sky-salmon-and-sky-salmon-stew/">Sky Salmon and Sky Salmon Stew</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>We arrive at a shop.

Good job!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo,¬†that‚Äôs all the required information.‚ÄÇThe other information is not required.‚ÄÇBut some info about your specialization is recommended.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúCan I give ‚Äòintelligence specialist‚Äô as specialization?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs not a problem.‚ÄÇIt just has to describe your abilities without revealing your hand too much.‚ÄÇWith this, we‚Äôre done with the registration.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt hands her his form.</p> <p>‚ÄúThank you. Since you‚Äôre all underage, you‚Äôd usually need to pass a battle assessment.‚ÄÇBut with the guild master‚Äôs authorization, you‚Äôre exempt from that.‚Äù</p> <p>She put two translucent cards on the counter.</p> <p>‚ÄúI need a drop of blood on those cards to attune these cards to you.‚Äù</p> <p>She gives us a needle each. I poke in my left index finger and let a drop fall on the card.‚ÄÇThe card shines for a brief moment and turns red copper.</p> <p>‚ÄúBy the way, I‚Äôm Lynette Taru, a Kouniklanthrope.‚ÄÇSince you‚Äôre just registering for formalities, I will just explain how Guild Cards work: the have your name, your party affiliation, and your specialization on it.‚ÄÇThe colour of the card is your current rank.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôre currently bronze rank.‚ÄÇThese cards can also serve as your identification.‚ÄÇPlease don‚Äôt lose those!‚ÄÇReissuing them costs money depending on your rank but at least one Gold Coin.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIdentification?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she picks up my card, ‚Äúif someone who‚Äôs not their owner holds the card for more than <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> seconds it turns translucent.‚Äù</p> <p>Just as she says it, the card turns completely translucent. She gives me my card back.</p> <p>‚ÄúBut if you get it back, it will become the correct colour again.‚Äù</p> <p>And it does turn back to bronze.</p> <p>‚ÄúCan I have your cards for a minute to record your feat?‚ÄÇAlso, I‚Äôll make a note on your cards so you‚Äôll get your full orienteering when you actually start adventuring.‚Äù</p> <p>I give her my card and she put it into recess on her side of the counter.‚ÄÇThen, she taps a metal plate on her counter and letters appear on the plate as if that plate were a tablet!‚ÄÇI wonder how it works‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAfter tinkering a while, she gives me back my card.‚ÄÇI put it into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇAnd repeats the same procedure with Matt‚Äôs card.‚ÄÇSince we‚Äôre done here, we leave the building.</p> <p>Matt‚Äôs group escorts me to the western gate.</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks for taking me along.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to have you. Will you find you way back?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll manage. Goodbye, until next time.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúUntil next time.‚Äù</p> <p>I show my guild card to the guard and make my way towards the forest.‚ÄÇWhen I‚Äôm far enough from the city the Bunnyflies make themselves visible again.‚ÄÇWhen we arrive at the cave, I pour the Bunnyflies another bowl of maple wine.</p> <p><em>¬´I hope you weren‚Äôt too bored.¬ª</em></p> <p>It‚Äôs already dark outside, but it‚Äôs still early so I figure I should try experimenting some more.‚ÄÇI should try getting the hang of the Feline Form transformation.</p> <p>I close my eyes and I imagine turning into a cat.‚ÄÇWhen I open my eyes, I‚Äôm the height I was yesterday morning.‚ÄÇMy clothes have fallen off me.‚ÄÇCan I transform without closing my eyes?‚ÄÇI try. It works.‚ÄÇWithout bothering to get dressed, I try transforming into a cat while I jump on to my bed.‚ÄÇI can barely make it in time and my footing is slightly off, but it works.‚ÄÇTransforming is tiring‚Ä¶ I should just drop here on my bed‚Ä¶ and sleep‚Ä¶‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" My First Trip to the Capital!" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/29-my-first-trip-to-the-capital/">My First Trip to the Capital!</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Sky Salmon and Sky Salmon Stew" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/31-sky-salmon-and-sky-salmon-stew/">Sky Salmon and Sky Salmon Stew</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="qu·ªëc Th√°i ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">qu·ªëc Th√°i ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
