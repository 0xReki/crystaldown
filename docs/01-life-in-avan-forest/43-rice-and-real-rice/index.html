I simply put it into a pot with water and cook it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then, nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt drain the water?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù I shake my head, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd remove all the flavour!‚Äù I‚Äôm shocked‚Ä¶ Silas and Alexander look into the kitchen. ‚ÄúBut what about impurities in the rice?‚Äù Alexander asks.‚ÄÇSilas and Alexander are standing in the doorway.‚ÄÇIt seems like they were listening to our conversation. ‚ÄúYou rinse the rice before putting in the water to cook it,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve been doing it wrong all the time‚Ä¶‚Äù Alexander mumbles.‚ÄÇHe claps with hands, ‚ÄúI learned something new!‚Äù ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ you usually cook it in a lot of water then drain the water?!‚Äù That how you cook dried pasta‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAnd rice definitely isn‚Äôt pasta!! ‚ÄúYes,¬†that‚Äôs how many people cook rice.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not exactly a staple food.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs cheap, so people use it.‚ÄÇNobody has ever questioned that method before‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù Oh my‚Ä¶ what else is going to be different?‚ÄÇMaybe their tea is something like herbs that have been brewed in hot water? I get the pots off the oven and take one of the pots and put in some fruit juice and some vinegar.‚ÄÇRice vinegar would be better, but I‚Äôve no idea how to actually make that.‚ÄÇI mix in the contents of the pot thoroughly.‚ÄÇAfter that, I put the pot into the fridge‚Ä¶ at least that‚Äôs what I planned. I forgot to make a fridge‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI‚Äôm getting absentminded‚Ä¶‚ÄÇThis is very unusual!‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not much of a scatterbrain.‚ÄÇGranted, I was when I was young, I‚Äôd lose my head if it wasn‚Äôt fixed to the body, but nowadays I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve got my stuff somewhat sorted‚Ä¶ Such much about my to do list‚Ä¶‚ÄÇIs my mind turning back to that of a kid as well?‚ÄÇAnyway, I need to cool the rice.‚ÄÇUsing Absolute Zero is probably overkill‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúKat,¬†can you try to freeze this with the spell I showed you?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶ So colder than even ice‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat answers, ‚ÄúAbsolute Zero!‚Äù The pot freezes ‚Äî I can feel the cold.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs not as cold as it would liquefy air. ‚ÄúHmm,¬†that‚Äôs still too warm‚Ä¶‚ÄÇWell, I half expected that.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs just what I need.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really imagine how it‚Äôs supposed to work‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try to think of something to explain‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut food comes first!‚Äù I put the pot of frozen rice next to the tray of frozen fish. ‚ÄúNow I need to wait for those to thaw.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs taking a while‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚ÄÇI know good food takes a while to make,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúthough I can hardly wait.‚Äù After a while, the fish and rice begin to thaw.‚ÄÇI get three plates and spread them on the table.‚ÄÇI take the fish and cut them to pieces of 3 different sizes.‚ÄÇOne size, I leave as is.‚ÄÇAnd put them ‚Äî the Sashimi ‚Äî them on the first plate.‚ÄÇThe second size put on a similar-sized portion of rice.‚ÄÇI put the resulting sushi on the second plate.‚ÄÇThe last size I roll in the Futo leaves with rice.‚ÄÇI put the resulting the Maki Rolls on the last plate. ‚ÄúThis would be better with some soy sauce but it‚Äôs done.‚Äù ‚ÄúSoy sauce?

I‚Äôve never eaten that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt? Is rice considered too low-class food?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†that‚Äôs not it,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just not many people around here know how to properly prepare it.‚ÄÇIt usually ends up tasteless and odourless.‚ÄÇSo the palace chefs never bother using it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve never experienced the smell of rice this intensive,‚Äù Pat adds, ‚Äúhow did you cook it?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHow? I simply put it into a pot with water and cook it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd then, nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt drain the water?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù I shake my head, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd remove all the flavour!‚Äù</p> <p>I‚Äôm shocked‚Ä¶ Silas and Alexander look into the kitchen.</p> <p>‚ÄúBut what about impurities in the rice?‚Äù Alexander asks.‚ÄÇSilas and Alexander are standing in the doorway.‚ÄÇIt seems like they were listening to our conversation.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou rinse the rice before putting in the water to cook it,‚Äù I answer.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve been doing it wrong all the time‚Ä¶‚Äù Alexander mumbles.‚ÄÇHe claps with hands, ‚ÄúI learned something new!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ you usually cook it in a lot of water then drain the water?!‚Äù</p> <p>That how you cook dried pasta‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAnd rice definitely isn‚Äôt pasta!!</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†that‚Äôs how many people cook rice.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not exactly a staple food.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs cheap, so people use it.‚ÄÇNobody has ever questioned that method before‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>Oh my‚Ä¶ what else is going to be different?‚ÄÇMaybe their tea is something like herbs that have been brewed in hot water?</p> <p>I get the pots off the oven and take one of the pots and put in some fruit juice and some vinegar.‚ÄÇRice vinegar would be better, but I‚Äôve no idea how to actually make that.‚ÄÇI mix in the contents of the pot thoroughly.‚ÄÇAfter that, I put the pot into the fridge‚Ä¶ at least that‚Äôs what I planned.</p> <p>I forgot to make a fridge‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI‚Äôm getting absentminded‚Ä¶‚ÄÇThis is very unusual!‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not much of a scatterbrain.‚ÄÇGranted, I was when I was young, I‚Äôd lose my head if it wasn‚Äôt fixed to the body, but nowadays I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve got my stuff somewhat sorted‚Ä¶ Such much about my to do list‚Ä¶‚ÄÇIs my mind turning back to that of a kid as well?‚ÄÇAnyway, I need to cool the rice.‚ÄÇUsing <em>Absolute Zero</em> is probably overkill‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúKat,¬†can you try to freeze this with the spell I showed you?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶ So colder than even ice‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat answers, <em>‚ÄúAbsolute Zero!‚Äù</em></p> <p>The pot freezes ‚Äî I can feel the cold.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs not as cold as it would liquefy air.</p> <p>‚ÄúHmm,¬†that‚Äôs still too warm‚Ä¶‚ÄÇWell, I half expected that.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs just what I need.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really imagine how it‚Äôs supposed to work‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try to think of something to explain‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut food comes first!‚Äù</p> <p>I put the pot of frozen rice next to the tray of frozen fish.</p> <p>‚ÄúNow I need to wait for those to thaw.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs taking a while‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚ÄÇI know good food takes a while to make,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúthough I can hardly wait.‚Äù</p> <p>After a while, the fish and rice begin to thaw.‚ÄÇI get three plates and spread them on the table.‚ÄÇI take the fish and cut them to pieces of 3 different sizes.‚ÄÇOne size, I leave as is.‚ÄÇAnd put them ‚Äî the Sashimi ‚Äî them on the first plate.‚ÄÇThe second size put on a similar-sized portion of rice.‚ÄÇI put the resulting sushi on the second plate.‚ÄÇThe last size I roll in the Futo leaves with rice.‚ÄÇI put the resulting the Maki Rolls on the last plate.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis would be better with some soy sauce but it‚Äôs done.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSoy sauce? Never heard of that before.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLet me think‚Ä¶‚Äù I quickly look up the soy sauce in <em>How to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with Cratherion Ingredients</em>, ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/42-hot-spring-after-a-trip-in-the-rain/">Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="How to Improve on Maple Wine" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/44-how-to-improve-on-maple-wine/">How to Improve on Maple Wine</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
