A short while later he opens them again. ‚ÄúFire Ball!‚Äù A ball of fire appears in front of Swift and flies to the boulder. ‚ÄúThat was also stronger than I expected.‚ÄÇI wonder if this is an effect of this Feline Form or just the effect of the full moon‚Ä¶‚ÄÇSo,¬†do you mind, not training today?‚ÄÇI think I want to make use of this excess power to create a Magic Space.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Seth seems very open to this. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù Sain adds.‚ÄÇIt must be.‚ÄÇAfter all, Sain is our magic expert. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Swift walks back into the cave.
