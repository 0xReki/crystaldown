is ready!¬ª I begin eating.‚ÄÇI think my cooking is improving.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm still missing some spices, but I can manage.‚ÄÇMy hand-eye coordination has greatly improved as well.‚ÄÇMaking use of my trait Nimble and Precise, I now primarily move in the forest by jumping from treetop to treetop.‚ÄÇAfter I finish my portion, Raiden is still not here. What‚Äôs going on?‚ÄÇUsually, it takes Raiden only a few minutes to get here.‚ÄÇI try to mentally connect to Raiden.‚ÄÇThere he is.‚ÄÇI sense Raiden calling me over.‚ÄÇI feel a sense of wariness from Raiden.‚ÄÇI leave my cave and move to where I feel Raiden currently is.‚ÄÇI keep myself hidden.‚ÄÇI find Raiden in one of the trees.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs unharmed!‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs a relief.‚ÄÇJust as I wanted to ask him about what happened, I see who Raiden is intently watching: we have visitors!‚ÄÇThere are several people in the forest, all men, they all wear similar armour.‚ÄÇMost of them seem to be Humes.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs one Ailuranthrope with them.‚ÄÇOne of the Humes seems to be my age.‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt seen other people here until now.‚ÄÇWhat are they doing here? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù the boy shouts.‚ÄÇHave I been spotted? ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre imagining things,‚Äù one of the men says.‚ÄÇThe rest starts laughing.‚ÄÇSo was it just a fluke? ¬´Lunch is on the table. Go home and eat,¬ª I send Raiden away. Raiden takes the skies.‚ÄÇThe boy sees Raiden fly up and exclaims: ‚ÄúThere, a Hawk!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat was just a lucky guess!‚Äù one of the adults says. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚ÄÇBut still, I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd get this lost in the forest‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how Avan Forest is.‚Äù He takes glances in my direction. ‚ÄúI just probed the area‚Ä¶, there‚Äôs nothing there,‚Äù one of the other adults says. It looks like my Presence Isolation skill is very effective.‚ÄÇThat being the case, I‚Äôm quite confident I can escape if something happens.‚ÄÇI should show myself and talk to them.‚ÄÇI jump down.‚ÄÇUpon noticing me, the men stop laughing.‚ÄÇThey immediately put their hands at their hips, ready to draw their swords at any time.‚ÄÇI should have walked in from somewhere else‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite sharp!‚Äù I smile.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs just hope my Appealing Charisma trait helps.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúHello there, my name is Swift. I live around here.‚Äù The boy makes a triumphant expression. ‚ÄúSo I wasn‚Äôt imagining it! I‚Äôm Matt. Nice to meet you.‚Äù The men are whispering. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a kid doing here alone?‚Äù ‚ÄúI just probed the area‚Ä¶, I was sure nobody was there a moment ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt seems he isn‚Äôt a threat.‚Äù I turn to the men. ‚ÄúI can hear you‚Ä¶‚ÄÇIf you dislike my presence that much, I can just leave. I don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI was just curious since nobody ever comes to this forest‚Ä¶‚Äù I turn around to leave the place. ‚ÄúNo,¬†wait!‚Äù the boy, I think his name was Matt, shouts.‚ÄÇI turn to him.‚ÄÇThe men look like they want to protest.‚ÄÇBut he silences them with a stare, not an angry one.‚ÄÇThey loosen up a bit.‚ÄÇThey‚Äôre still wary of me.‚ÄÇBut I don‚Äôt have to worry about them drawing their weapons for now.‚ÄÇIt looks like Matt is in charge, even though he‚Äôs the youngest of the group.‚ÄÇAnd he wields quite the authority, too. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come here in search of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇBut we‚Äôre kinda lost here‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Crystal Down?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs a hill in this forest that‚Äôs full of Awakening Crystals.‚Äù That cliff had a name? ‚ÄúAh,¬†that place!‚ÄÇI know where it is.‚ÄÇShould I lead the way?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†please do!‚Äù I walk ahead to lead the way to the Awakening Crystals.‚ÄÇMatt walks directly next to me.‚ÄÇThe others follow behind us. ‚ÄúSo Matt, are you looking for a certain trait or skill?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot really, I‚Äôm here because of one of my family‚Äôs many traditions.‚ÄÇAt age X (), we‚Äôre supposed to try going to the Crystal Down and get a trait or a skill. If we get something useful, we get extra points on the succession score.‚ÄÇI was told only to get something if I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not bad for me.‚ÄÇIf we get something detrimental, we get negative points or even disqualification.‚ÄÇNobody knows what you‚Äôre going to get.‚ÄÇSo I‚Äôm just hoping I find something that‚Äôs not bad for me.‚Äù So they have a merit-based system for succession here?‚ÄÇThat sounds better than always choosing the eldest.‚ÄÇAre they to choose something based on instinct?‚ÄÇOr is this a lucky chance thing? ‚ÄúThe detrimental traits those crystal give can be quite nasty.‚ÄÇIs it worth the risk getting these?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs an optional thing.‚ÄÇIf I‚Äôm not sure about it, I should simply opt out, even at this stage.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇBack to my question: if you could choose what you get, what would you want?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf possible, I‚Äôd like to receive the Light Magic skill.‚Äù ‚ÄúLight Magic skill?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs very hard to raise.‚ÄÇSo having it would help quite a lot.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just guessing,‚Äù Matt moves closer to me, and whispers, ‚Äúbut judging from your question, could it be that you can discern what effects the Awakening Crystals have?‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs incredible!‚ÄÇNobody has ever been able to do that!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd you believe me?‚ÄÇJust like that?‚ÄÇWe have just met, you know.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I have a skill that allows me to guess if something might be detrimental to me.‚ÄÇYou seem fine.‚ÄÇIn fact, I‚Äôm just trying to prove the skill I have is real.‚ÄÇI know it is.‚ÄÇIt can‚Äôt be I‚Äôm right just by chance.‚ÄÇThe problem is: it doesn‚Äôt turn up on Identifying Crystals.‚ÄÇSo even if you were lying, it‚Äôll be my fault for trusting you, and my skill is just my imagination.‚ÄÇEnough about me, I can‚Äôt say I expected to meet someone else in this forest‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy? It is comparatively safe here.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese woods are very special.‚ÄÇPeople that get in here this deep usually get lost, just like our group.‚Äù We arrive near the cliff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here,‚Äù I point uphill, ‚Äúthe crystals are just up there.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat was faster than expected.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†we‚Äôve been wandering around for bells before you arrived.‚ÄÇAnd you brought us here in not even half a bell!‚ÄÇHow don‚Äôt you get lost?‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say, I just don‚Äôt get lost‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAnyway, let‚Äôs look for your Awakening Crystal of Light Magic!‚Äù I lead the group up onto the hill.‚ÄÇWhile doing that, I try looking for an Awakening Crystal of Light Magic.‚ÄÇSurprisingly, I find one quite fast.‚ÄÇWhen we arrive near it, I point to the white crystal and whisper: ‚ÄúI believe this is the one you are looking for.‚Äù Matt looks at me, then at the crystal.‚ÄÇWithout hesitation, he grabs it.‚ÄÇIt begins shining brightly.‚ÄÇAfter the light dies down, the crystal has turned translucent as it happened with me before. One of the men touches Matt with an orb.‚ÄÇAfter looking at the orb for a while he says: ‚ÄúYou seem to have gained Light Magic Level 4.‚ÄÇCongratulations, though that doesn‚Äôt prove that other skill of yours exists.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know, thanks.‚Äù Since they‚Äôre done with their objective.‚ÄÇThey decide to leave right away.‚ÄÇI lead them to the river nearby and see them off. ‚ÄúIf you follow this river, you should get out of this forest quite fast.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks for your help, Swift.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it, I was just bored, anyway.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not every day that I meet people in this forest.‚Äù I leave and hide in the trees.‚ÄÇIt seems I‚Äôm not being followed.‚ÄÇThe group is still in viewing distance.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs analyze the boy.‚ÄÇDoes it even work on him? Character Info Name: Matthew Sitnalta Age: X Species: Hume Titles &amp; Blessings Second Prince of Sitnalta Traits Protector Spirit (Trait) Super Intuition (Hidden Trait) Skills Fighting Long Blade Mastery Level 1 () Shield Mastery Level 2 () Magic Skills Light Magic Level 4 () Survival Skills Riding Level 2 () So the first person my age I meet turns out to be a prince.‚ÄÇThe second prince, no less.‚ÄÇI guess merit-based successions make even more sense in a royal family!‚Ä¶‚ÄÇThat means this place is run by a monarchy.‚ÄÇBut he doesn‚Äôt seem to care much about this position.‚ÄÇHe has a Hidden Trait, Super Intuition.‚ÄÇDoesn‚Äôt that mean those crystals don‚Äôt pick up Hidden Traits?‚ÄÇThat would explain quite a lot!‚ÄÇAlso, that would be quite convenient for me‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI make a note: check myself it an Identifying Crystal.‚ÄÇWell, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll meet him again.‚ÄÇAnd if I do, I‚Äôll just ignore the fact he‚Äôs royalty.‚ÄÇAfter all, he didn‚Äôt seem to mind.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 15: Visitors in the Forest"> Visitors in the Forest </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-01-01, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/NotKeoni#1327" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">notKeoni</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Cave Upgrade ‚Äî Adding a Hot Spring and a Bedroom" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/14-cave-upgrade-adding-a-hot-spring-and-a-bedroom/">Cave Upgrade ‚Äî Adding a Hot Spring and a Bedroom</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="On the Way Home from the Forest" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/16-on-the-way-home-from-the-forest/">On the Way Home from the Forest</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>A few days later, it‚Äôs about lunchtime.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm done with preparing lunch.</p> <p><em>¬´Raiden, lunch is ready!¬ª</em></p> <p>I begin eating.‚ÄÇI think my cooking is improving.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm still missing some spices, but I can manage.‚ÄÇMy hand-eye coordination has greatly improved as well.‚ÄÇMaking use of my trait Nimble and Precise, I now primarily move in the forest by jumping from treetop to treetop.‚ÄÇAfter I finish my portion, Raiden is still not here.</p> <p>What‚Äôs going on?‚ÄÇUsually, it takes Raiden only a few minutes to get here.‚ÄÇI try to mentally connect to Raiden.‚ÄÇThere he is.‚ÄÇI sense Raiden calling me over.‚ÄÇI feel a sense of wariness from Raiden.‚ÄÇI leave my cave and move to where I feel Raiden currently is.‚ÄÇI keep myself hidden.‚ÄÇI find Raiden in one of the trees.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs unharmed!‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs a relief.‚ÄÇJust as I wanted to ask him about what happened, I see who Raiden is intently watching: we have visitors!‚ÄÇThere are several people in the forest, all men, they all wear similar armour.‚ÄÇMost of them seem to be Humes.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs one Ailuranthrope with them.‚ÄÇOne of the Humes seems to be my age.‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt seen other people here until now.‚ÄÇWhat are they doing here?</p> <p>‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù the boy shouts.‚ÄÇHave I been spotted?</p> <p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre imagining things,‚Äù one of the men says.‚ÄÇThe rest starts laughing.‚ÄÇSo was it just a fluke?</p> <p><em>¬´Lunch is on the table.

I don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI was just curious since nobody ever comes to this forest‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>I turn around to leave the place.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†wait!‚Äù the boy, I think his name was Matt, shouts.‚ÄÇI turn to him.‚ÄÇThe men look like they want to protest.‚ÄÇBut he silences them with a stare, not an angry one.‚ÄÇThey loosen up a bit.‚ÄÇThey‚Äôre still wary of me.‚ÄÇBut I don‚Äôt have to worry about them drawing their weapons for now.‚ÄÇIt looks like Matt is in charge, even though he‚Äôs the youngest of the group.‚ÄÇAnd he wields quite the authority, too.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve come here in search of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇBut we‚Äôre kinda lost here‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThe Crystal Down?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs a hill in this forest that‚Äôs full of Awakening Crystals.‚Äù</p> <p>That cliff had a name?</p> <p>‚ÄúAh,¬†that place!‚ÄÇI know where it is.‚ÄÇShould I lead the way?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†please do!‚Äù</p> <p>I walk ahead to lead the way to the Awakening Crystals.‚ÄÇMatt walks directly next to me.‚ÄÇThe others follow behind us.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo Matt, are you looking for a certain trait or skill?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNot really, I‚Äôm here because of one of my family‚Äôs many traditions.‚ÄÇAt age <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, we‚Äôre supposed to try going to the Crystal Down and get a trait or a skill.</p> <p>If we get something useful, we get extra points on the succession score.‚ÄÇI was told only to get something if I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not bad for me.‚ÄÇIf we get something detrimental, we get negative points or even disqualification.‚ÄÇNobody knows what you‚Äôre going to get.‚ÄÇSo I‚Äôm just hoping I find something that‚Äôs not bad for me.‚Äù</p> <p>So they have a merit-based system for succession here?‚ÄÇThat sounds better than always choosing the eldest.‚ÄÇAre they to choose something based on instinct?‚ÄÇOr is this a lucky chance thing?</p> <p>‚ÄúThe detrimental traits those crystal give can be quite nasty.‚ÄÇIs it worth the risk getting these?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs an optional thing.‚ÄÇIf I‚Äôm not sure about it, I should simply opt out, even at this stage.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇBack to my question: if you could choose what you get, what would you want?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf possible, I‚Äôd like to receive the Light Magic skill.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLight Magic skill?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs very hard to raise.‚ÄÇSo having it would help quite a lot.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm just guessing,‚Äù Matt moves closer to me, and whispers, ‚Äúbut judging from your question, could it be that you can discern what effects the Awakening Crystals have?‚Äù</p> <p>I nod.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs incredible!‚ÄÇNobody has ever been able to do that!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd you believe me?‚ÄÇJust like that?‚ÄÇWe have just met, you know.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, I have a skill that allows me to guess if something might be detrimental to me.‚ÄÇYou seem fine.‚ÄÇIn fact, I‚Äôm just trying to prove the skill I have is real.‚ÄÇI know it is.‚ÄÇIt can‚Äôt be I‚Äôm right just by chance.‚ÄÇThe problem is: it doesn‚Äôt turn up on Identifying Crystals.‚ÄÇSo even if you were lying, it‚Äôll be my fault for trusting you, and my skill is just my imagination.‚ÄÇEnough about me, I can‚Äôt say I expected to meet someone else in this forest‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy? It is comparatively safe here.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThese woods are very special.‚ÄÇPeople that get in here this deep usually get lost, just like our group.‚Äù</p> <p>We arrive near the cliff.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here,‚Äù I point uphill, ‚Äúthe crystals are just up there.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat was faster than expected.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†we‚Äôve been wandering around for bells before you arrived.‚ÄÇAnd you brought us here in not even half a bell!‚ÄÇHow don‚Äôt you get lost?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say, I just don‚Äôt get lost‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAnyway, let‚Äôs look for your Awakening Crystal of Light Magic!‚Äù</p> <p>I lead the group up onto the hill.‚ÄÇWhile doing that, I try looking for an Awakening Crystal of Light Magic.‚ÄÇSurprisingly, I find one quite fast.‚ÄÇWhen we arrive near it, I point to the white crystal and whisper: ‚ÄúI believe this is the one you are looking for.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt looks at me, then at the crystal.‚ÄÇWithout hesitation, he grabs it.‚ÄÇIt begins shining brightly.‚ÄÇAfter the light dies down, the crystal has turned translucent as it happened with me before.</p> <p>One of the men touches Matt with an orb.‚ÄÇAfter looking at the orb for a while he says: ‚ÄúYou seem to have gained Light Magic Level 4.‚ÄÇCongratulations, though that doesn‚Äôt prove that other skill of yours exists.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI know, thanks.‚Äù</p> <p>Since they‚Äôre done with their objective.‚ÄÇThey decide to leave right away.‚ÄÇI lead them to the river nearby and see them off.</p> <p>‚ÄúIf you follow this river, you should get out of this forest quite fast.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks for your help, Swift.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it, I was just bored, anyway.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not every day that I meet people in this forest.‚Äù</p> <p>I leave and hide in the trees.‚ÄÇIt seems I‚Äôm not being followed.‚ÄÇThe group is still in viewing distance.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs analyze the boy.‚ÄÇDoes it even work on him?</p> <blockquote class="interface " style="order: 20"> <p onclick="toggleAccordion(this)" class="inactive">Character Info</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Name: <td>Matthew Sitnalta <tr> <td>Age: <td>X <tr> <td>Species: <td>Hume </table> <blockquote class="interface"> <p onclick="toggleAccordion(this)" class="inactive">Titles &amp;
