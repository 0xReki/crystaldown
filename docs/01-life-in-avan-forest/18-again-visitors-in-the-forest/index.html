They seem to be calling you.¬ª The same group as before? Who?‚ÄÇOh,¬†I remember! The group of the second prince.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs back?‚ÄÇI move to where Raiden is.‚ÄÇI see the group.‚ÄÇYes,¬†it‚Äôs the same group as last time.‚ÄÇI have Raiden sit on my shoulder as I jump down. ‚ÄúHey! It‚Äôs been a while, Matt.‚Äù ‚ÄúSwift! I‚Äôm glad to find you.‚ÄÇI wanted to drop by to thank you for your help last time.‚Äù Help? Oh,¬†yeah, I did help him a lot last time.‚ÄÇMaybe he can help me with my hunting problem. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that, I was just killing time.‚ÄÇAt least that‚Äôs what I want to say.‚ÄÇI do have a problem I need solving.‚Äù Matt‚Äôs face turns bright. ‚ÄúJust say it, maybe I can help!‚Äù ‚ÄúI was just hunting‚Ä¶‚ÄÇFor some reason, I can‚Äôt seem to hit anything today.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait, you were hunting with these arrows?‚Äù the Ailuranthrope that‚Äôs accompanying Matt interjects, ‚Äúsorry to interrupt. But I couldn‚Äôt help myself.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúcome to think of it, I haven‚Äôt introduced the others to you.‚ÄÇThe one just now is Silas.‚ÄÇThe others are Sain and Seth.‚Äù They each nod respectively when Matt mentions their name. ‚ÄúYou might already know it, but still: I‚Äôm Swift.‚ÄÇPleased to meet you,‚Äù I turn to Silas, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with my arrows?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas takes a deep breath, ‚Äúthose arrows are completely worn out, you need new ones!‚Äù ‚ÄúNew arrows‚Ä¶‚Äù I mutter to myself, ‚Äúthat could be a problem‚Ä¶‚Äù The men start laughing.‚ÄÇSeeing me being confused, Seth explains. ‚ÄúWith you being the Keeper of the Crystal Down, we weren‚Äôt sure how to treat you.‚ÄÇBut you seem more and more like a very specialized person.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not a special person, I think.‚ÄÇSpecialized maybe.‚ÄÇI do have the title Keeper of Crystal Down, but that doesn‚Äôt change much‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI still breathe and eat.‚ÄÇSince you‚Äôre here, should I take you to my place?‚ÄÇWe can continue talking there.‚Äù I lead them to my cave.‚ÄÇI push the ivy aside to reveal the entrance.‚ÄÇThe Bunnyflies come out.‚ÄÇThey circle around me. ‚ÄúI know you guys want to play,‚Äù I speak instead of using telepathy so the others can hear, ‚Äúbut we have guests right now.‚ÄÇSo you guys have to wait.‚Äù My guests open their eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease, tell me if I‚Äôm dreaming, but are those Bunnyflies?‚Äù ‚ÄúThose three? Yes,¬†those are Bunnyflies I contracted.‚ÄÇAs you can see, they are very playful.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou contracted them?!‚ÄÇWait, I thought that Hawk on your shoulder is just an unusual hawk, but could it be that‚Äôs a Thunder Hawk?‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúJust after we establish you being a normal person, there‚Äôs one surprise after another with you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI just happened to come across them and the taming spell happened to work.‚ÄÇAnyway, please come in!‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you do live here by yourself.‚Äù Are they trying to get me to move?‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôm not done with this place‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI have Raiden and others with me.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven so I can‚Äôt simply see a young boy like you live here without contact with other people and say nothing.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can manage.‚ÄÇBesides, I don‚Äôt know anyone outside I can rely on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù That‚Äôs the truth.‚ÄÇI go to the kitchen and hang the boar I hunted and let out the blood.‚ÄÇAfter that, I come back to the living room.‚ÄÇSain looks like he has a bright idea. ‚ÄúCan I use this on you?‚Äù he asks.‚ÄÇHe takes out his Identifying Crystal.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm quite sure my Hidden Traits won‚Äôt show up.‚ÄÇI wanted to know what it shows, anyway.and they seem trustworthy enough to me.‚ÄÇIn the worst case, I‚Äôm still positive I can get away fast enough. ‚ÄúPlease do, I‚Äôm interested in what it shows about me.‚Äù Sain touches me with the crystal. He looks at it. ‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶?!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Sain?‚Äù Seth walks behind Sain and has a look as well. He falls silent. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you have an impressive collection of titles.‚Äù I get the feeling they‚Äôre hiding something. ‚ÄúI mean really, what‚Äôs the matter? You are hiding something.‚Äù Sain bows and apologizes: ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have pried.‚ÄÇMixed Ailuranthropes usually aren‚Äôt welcome in both of their parents‚Äô communities.‚ÄÇYou must have been alone for quite a while‚Ä¶‚ÄÇEven your Survival Skills are top notch!‚ÄÇI guess I have to give up on convincing you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt that mean people won‚Äôt ask me much about my parents?‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs great!‚ÄÇOh yeah, I wanted to know what traits that crystal shows. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what traits do I have according to the crystal?‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me see‚Ä¶ Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge, Infinite Storage, Accelerated Recovery, Quick Learner, Appealing Charisma and Nimble &amp; Precise.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs quite a good set of traits.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt expect my Mystic Eyes to be visible, but that‚Äôs not a problem ‚Äî people would notice due to my heterochromia, anyway. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù We interrupt our conversation.‚ÄÇThe Bunnyflies seem to be quite interested in something Matt has with him. ‚ÄúI thought Bunnyflies were shy. But these look very clingy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are clingy.‚Äù ¬´We smell tasty water! We want tasty water!¬ª ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre even more clingy when they smell alcohol.‚ÄÇI think they smell some on you, Matt.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis?‚Äù Matt takes out a bottle from his pack, ‚Äúthis is some ale I bought on the way here.‚ÄÇCan I give it to them?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, let me get a bowl.‚Äù Matt pours some ale into the bowl I bring.‚ÄÇThe Bunnyflies start drinking.‚ÄÇOne slime crawls over to join them. I help it up. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt mind this slime.‚ÄÇIt likes alcohol as well.‚ÄÇThey are a soothing sight, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù Everyone nods. ‚ÄúBefore I forget, I want to give you some things as thanks for your help last time.‚Äù Matt starts lining of the gifts: two quivers full of arrows and a cloak.‚ÄÇI take the cloak and try it on. ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks. I just wonder what this crest is.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my personal crest.‚Äù ‚ÄúPersonal Crest?‚Äù Oh,¬†yes, I remember, he is the second prince.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs just feign ignorance. ‚ÄúLet me properly introduce myself.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm Matthew Sitnalta, the second prince of Sitnalta.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem surprised.‚Äù ‚ÄúShould I be?‚ÄÇI found out as you were leaving last time.‚ÄÇYou seemed to be tired of formalities, so I just ignored it.‚Äù Matt grins. ‚ÄúI like you, I really want to invite you to live in the castle with me.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôd shake up things quite a bit.‚Äù Now,¬†it‚Äôs come to this I can‚Äôt really decline. What to do now‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBut you seem set on staying here, so I won‚Äôt ask.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks for your consideration.‚Äù That‚Äôs great.‚ÄÇWhen I think about it, I imagine living in the castle might become a hassle, I‚Äôm not very keen on being subjected to intrigues and the likes. ‚ÄúBut expect me to drop by once in a while.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure. You‚Äôre welcome anytime.‚Äù ‚ÄúYoung Master, we need to get back soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlready? We barely sat down!‚Äù Matt has a look of disappointment. ‚ÄúYou need to be back by dusk.‚ÄÇNext time, plan more time for this.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to prepare a place to sleep for you guys by then.‚ÄÇThough you might want to bring some beddings.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease do!‚Äù Matt‚Äôs mood instantly improves. ‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre at it, I could use some flour.‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt been able to produce that in the forest.‚ÄÇAnd I‚Äôm starting to miss bread‚Ä¶‚Äù I still have some Lottery Boxes of Food I haven‚Äôt touched since I have started hunting.‚ÄÇMaybe‚Ä¶ No,¬†I‚Äôll have to restrain myself!‚ÄÇI want to savour those later. ‚ÄúFlour, I can take care of that!‚Äù I lead the group to the river again.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm surprised to see the Bunnyflies following us. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been way too short, but it was nice seeing you again.‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel the same. Till next time!‚ÄÇI won‚Äôt be going anywhere in the foreseeable future.‚ÄÇSo drop by whenever you feel like it.‚Äù As Matt‚Äôs group was leaving, I hear Flynn crying. ¬´I want to stay with friend!¬ª ¬´Don‚Äôt cry. He‚Äôll come back to visit soon.¬ª ¬´But I want to be with friend!!¬ª I sigh‚Ä¶ ¬´Even if it means leaving Faryl, Felix and me?¬ª ¬´I want to be with friend!!¬ª ¬´Master, please let Flynn go.¬ª ¬´Even the two of you‚Ä¶, wait, you don‚Äôt want to go?¬ª ¬´No,¬†our place is with master. But Flynn‚Äôs place is with friend.¬ª ¬´I get it. Come, let‚Äôs go after them.¬ª I chase after Matt‚Äôs group.‚ÄÇWhen I reach them they seem surprised I chased them. ‚ÄúWhat is the matter, Swift?‚ÄÇDid you change your mind?‚ÄÇDo you want to come to the castle with us?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†I don‚Äôt. But Flynn wants to stay with you. Is that OK?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, I don‚Äôt mind. Do I need to hide him? And what do Bunnyflies eat?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo what you think is best. They eat vegetables.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll transfer the contract then. Transfer Contract! There. Please take care of Flynn.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis time, really, till next time. See you!‚Äù ‚ÄúSee you!‚Äù I move towards my cave. Arriving at my cave, I drop into my chair.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt expect to meet them again‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI pour some maple wine into a bowl.‚ÄÇI wonder why Flynn insisted on leaving‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI decide to ask the other two about it. ¬´Faryl, Felix, why did Flynn want to go with Matt?¬ª ¬´Flynn is destined to be with friend.¬ª ¬´What about you?¬ª ¬´We are destined to be with master.¬ª It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. I don‚Äôt understand what they mean. ¬´Destined?¬ª ¬´Destined master shines most beautiful to us.¬ª Is that a unique quality of each individual?‚ÄÇOr is it just a certain skill or trait?‚ÄÇI wished I could learn more.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt think asking the Bunnyflies will give me more information.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 18: Again, Visitors in the Forest"> Again, Visitors in the Forest </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-01-08, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Bunnyflies Faryl, Felix and Flynn" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/17-bunnyflies-faryl-felix-and-flynn/">Bunnyflies Faryl, Felix and Flynn</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Worrying About the Future" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/19-worrying-about-the-future/">Worrying About the Future</a> </nav> </header> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 my-2 align-items-center tts-controls"> <p class="w-50 w-md-25 mb-0">Text to Speech:</p> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>A few days later, I‚Äôm on one of my hunts.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm sitting hidden in the bushes.‚ÄÇA horde of boars is about to pass by.‚ÄÇI knock an arrow, preparing to shoot.‚ÄÇThe boars pass by; I shoot.

But I couldn‚Äôt help myself.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúcome to think of it, I haven‚Äôt introduced the others to you.‚ÄÇThe one just now is Silas.‚ÄÇThe others are Sain and Seth.‚Äù</p> <p>They each nod respectively when Matt mentions their name.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou might already know it, but still: I‚Äôm Swift.‚ÄÇPleased to meet you,‚Äù I turn to Silas, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with my arrows?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas takes a deep breath, ‚Äúthose arrows are completely worn out, you need new ones!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNew arrows‚Ä¶‚Äù I mutter to myself, ‚Äúthat could be a problem‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>The men start laughing.‚ÄÇSeeing me being confused, Seth explains.</p> <p>‚ÄúWith you being the Keeper of the Crystal Down, we weren‚Äôt sure how to treat you.‚ÄÇBut you seem more and more like a very specialized person.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI am not a special person, I think.‚ÄÇSpecialized maybe.‚ÄÇI do have the title Keeper of Crystal Down, but that doesn‚Äôt change much‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI still breathe and eat.‚ÄÇSince you‚Äôre here, should I take you to my place?‚ÄÇWe can continue talking there.‚Äù</p> <p>I lead them to my cave.‚ÄÇI push the ivy aside to reveal the entrance.‚ÄÇThe Bunnyflies come out.‚ÄÇThey circle around me.</p> <p>‚ÄúI know you guys want to play,‚Äù I speak instead of using telepathy so the others can hear, ‚Äúbut we have guests right now.‚ÄÇSo you guys have to wait.‚Äù</p> <p>My guests open their eyes wide.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúPlease, tell me if I‚Äôm dreaming, but are those Bunnyflies?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThose three? Yes,¬†those are Bunnyflies I contracted.‚ÄÇAs you can see, they are very playful.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou contracted them?!‚ÄÇWait, I thought that Hawk on your shoulder is just an unusual hawk, but could it be that‚Äôs a Thunder Hawk?‚Äù</p> <p>I nod.</p> <p>‚ÄúJust after we establish you being a normal person, there‚Äôs one surprise after another with you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI just happened to come across them and the taming spell happened to work.‚ÄÇAnyway, please come in!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo you do live here by yourself.‚Äù</p> <p>Are they trying to get me to move?‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôm not done with this place‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúI have Raiden and others with me.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúEven so I can‚Äôt simply see a young boy like you live here without contact with other people and say nothing.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI can manage.‚ÄÇBesides, I don‚Äôt know anyone outside I can rely on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù</p> <p>That‚Äôs the truth.‚ÄÇI go to the kitchen and hang the boar I hunted and let out the blood.‚ÄÇAfter that, I come back to the living room.‚ÄÇSain looks like he has a bright idea.</p> <p>‚ÄúCan I use this on you?‚Äù he asks.‚ÄÇHe takes out his Identifying Crystal.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm quite sure my Hidden Traits won‚Äôt show up.‚ÄÇI wanted to know what it shows, anyway.and they seem trustworthy enough to me.‚ÄÇIn the worst case, I‚Äôm still positive I can get away fast enough.</p> <p>‚ÄúPlease do, I‚Äôm interested in what it shows about me.‚Äù</p> <p>Sain touches me with the crystal. He looks at it.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶?!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Sain?‚Äù Seth walks behind Sain and has a look as well. He falls silent.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you have an impressive collection of titles.‚Äù</p> <p>I get the feeling they‚Äôre hiding something.</p> <p>‚ÄúI mean really, what‚Äôs the matter? You are hiding something.‚Äù</p> <p>Sain bows and apologizes: ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have pried.‚ÄÇMixed Ailuranthropes usually aren‚Äôt welcome in both of their parents‚Äô communities.‚ÄÇYou must have been alone for quite a while‚Ä¶‚ÄÇEven your Survival Skills are top notch!‚ÄÇI guess I have to give up on convincing you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù</p> <p>Doesn‚Äôt that mean people won‚Äôt ask me much about my parents?‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs great!‚ÄÇOh yeah, I wanted to know what traits that crystal shows.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what traits do I have according to the crystal?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLet me see‚Ä¶ Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge, Infinite Storage, Accelerated Recovery, Quick Learner, Appealing Charisma and Nimble &amp; Precise.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs quite a good set of traits.‚Äù</p> <p>I didn‚Äôt expect my Mystic Eyes to be visible, but that‚Äôs not a problem ‚Äî people would notice due to my heterochromia, anyway.</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚Äù</p> <p>We interrupt our conversation.‚ÄÇThe Bunnyflies seem to be quite interested in something Matt has with him.</p> <p>‚ÄúI thought Bunnyflies were shy. But these look very clingy.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThey are clingy.‚Äù</p> <p><em>¬´We smell tasty water! We want tasty water!¬ª</em></p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre even more clingy when they smell alcohol.‚ÄÇI think they smell some on you, Matt.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThis?‚Äù Matt takes out a bottle from his pack, ‚Äúthis is some ale I bought on the way here.‚ÄÇCan I give it to them?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure, let me get a bowl.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt pours some ale into the bowl I bring.‚ÄÇThe Bunnyflies start drinking.‚ÄÇOne slime crawls over to join them. I help it up.</p> <p>‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt mind this slime.‚ÄÇIt likes alcohol as well.‚ÄÇThey are a soothing sight, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù</p> <p>Everyone nods.</p> <p>‚ÄúBefore I forget, I want to give you some things as thanks for your help last time.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt starts lining of the gifts: two quivers full of arrows and a cloak.‚ÄÇI take the cloak and try it on.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks. I just wonder what this crest is.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my personal crest.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúPersonal Crest?‚Äù Oh,¬†yes, I remember, he is the second prince.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs just feign ignorance.</p> <p>‚ÄúLet me properly introduce myself.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm Matthew Sitnalta, the second prince of Sitnalta.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem surprised.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúShould I be?‚ÄÇI found out as you were leaving last time.‚ÄÇYou seemed to be tired of formalities, so I just ignored it.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt grins.</p> <p>‚ÄúI like you, I really want to invite you to live in the castle with me.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôd shake up things quite a bit.‚Äù</p> <p>Now,¬†it‚Äôs come to this I can‚Äôt really decline. What to do now‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúBut you seem set on staying here, so I won‚Äôt ask.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks for your consideration.‚Äù</p> <p>That‚Äôs great.‚ÄÇWhen I think about it, I imagine living in the castle might become a hassle, I‚Äôm not very keen on being subjected to intrigues and the likes.</p> <p>‚ÄúBut expect me to drop by once in a while.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure. You‚Äôre welcome anytime.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYoung Master, we need to get back soon.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAlready? We barely sat down!‚Äù Matt has a look of disappointment.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou need to be back by dusk.‚ÄÇNext time, plan more time for this.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to prepare a place to sleep for you guys by then.‚ÄÇThough you might want to bring some beddings.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúPlease do!‚Äù Matt‚Äôs mood instantly improves.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre at it, I could use some flour.‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt been able to produce that in the forest.‚ÄÇAnd I‚Äôm starting to miss bread‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>I still have some Lottery Boxes of Food I haven‚Äôt touched since I have started hunting.‚ÄÇMaybe‚Ä¶ No,¬†I‚Äôll have to restrain myself!‚ÄÇI want to savour those later.</p> <p>‚ÄúFlour, I can take care of that!‚Äù</p> <p>I lead the group to the river again.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm surprised to see the Bunnyflies following us.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been way too short, but it was nice seeing you again.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI feel the same. Till next time!‚ÄÇI won‚Äôt be going anywhere in the foreseeable future.‚ÄÇSo drop by whenever you feel like it.‚Äù</p> <p>As Matt‚Äôs group was leaving, I hear Flynn crying.</p> <p><em>¬´I want to stay with friend!¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´Don‚Äôt cry. He‚Äôll come back to visit soon.¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´But I want to be with friend!!¬ª</em></p> <p>I sigh‚Ä¶ <em>¬´Even if it means leaving Faryl, Felix and me?¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´I want to be with friend!!¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´Master, please let Flynn go.¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´Even the two of you‚Ä¶, wait, you don‚Äôt want to go?¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´No,¬†our place is with master. But Flynn‚Äôs place is with friend.¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´I get it. Come, let‚Äôs go after them.¬ª</em></p> <p>I chase after Matt‚Äôs group.‚ÄÇWhen I reach them they seem surprised I chased them.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat is the matter, Swift?‚ÄÇDid you change your mind?‚ÄÇDo you want to come to the castle with us?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†I don‚Äôt. But Flynn wants to stay with you. Is that OK?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure, I don‚Äôt mind. Do I need to hide him? And what do Bunnyflies eat?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDo what you think is best. They eat vegetables.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll transfer the contract then. <em>Transfer Contract!</em> There. Please take care of Flynn.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI will.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThis time, really, till next time. See you!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSee you!‚Äù</p> <p>I move towards my cave.</p> <p>Arriving at my cave, I drop into my chair.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt expect to meet them again‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI pour some maple wine into a bowl.‚ÄÇI wonder why Flynn insisted on leaving‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI decide to ask the other two about it.</p> <p><em>¬´Faryl, Felix, why did Flynn want to go with Matt?¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´Flynn is destined to be with friend.¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´What about you?¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´We are destined to be with master.¬ª</em></p> <p>It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. I don‚Äôt understand what they mean.</p> <p><em>¬´Destined?¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´Destined master shines most beautiful to us.¬ª</em></p> <p>Is that a unique quality of each individual?‚ÄÇOr is it just a certain skill or trait?‚ÄÇI wished I could learn more.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt think asking the Bunnyflies will give me more information.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Bunnyflies Faryl, Felix and Flynn" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/17-bunnyflies-faryl-felix-and-flynn/">Bunnyflies Faryl, Felix and Flynn</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Worrying About the Future" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/19-worrying-about-the-future/">Worrying About the Future</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="author noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
