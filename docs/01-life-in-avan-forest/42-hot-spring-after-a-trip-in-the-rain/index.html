‚ÄúI think we should move soon,‚Äù I tell the others. ‚ÄúWhere are we going to?‚Äù Kat asks. ‚ÄúThe forest, somewhere in the southern parts,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt guarantee it, but if you‚Äôre lucky, you get to see something special.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf Swift says it‚Äôs something special, it must be something truly special!‚Äù Matt jokes. The group puts on their rainwear and we leave the cave.‚ÄÇWe walk through the forest to the southern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs nothing at the location where I found the Sky Salmon.‚ÄÇWe continue strolling around.‚ÄÇEventually, we encounter a school of tuna flying in the air near the ground. ‚ÄúSky Tuna?!‚Äù even Luna seems to seem shocked. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs Sky Tuna this time‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumble. ‚ÄúThis time?!‚Äù Katherine asks. ‚ÄúWhy are you disappointed?!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs Sky Fish!‚Äù Matt asks, ‚ÄúThey are rarely ever seen!‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never seen any kind of those‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNeither have I‚Ä¶‚Äù Luna adds. ‚ÄúSo this is where you got them‚Ä¶‚Äù Patrick mumbles. ‚ÄúYes,¬†last time, I encountered a school of Sky Salmon.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not such a fan of tuna‚Ä¶‚Äù I mutter. I think a dozen or so should be plenty.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs shoot only a few at a time. ‚ÄúLaser! Laser! Laser! Laser!‚Äù The hit fish drop to the ground.‚ÄÇAgain, it smells like burnt flesh.‚ÄÇI collect them into my Infinite Storage. ‚ÄúThat should be enough for all of us.‚ÄÇBesides, I still have some Sky Salmon from last time.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you usually need a reinforced net to catch these?‚Äù Silas asks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard,‚Äù Alexander answers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard Swift is somewhat special.‚ÄÇBut I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that special‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs also some unusual magic you used!‚ÄÇWas that Fire Magic?‚Äù Patrick asks. ‚ÄúNo,¬†it‚Äôs Light Magic,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúLight Magic? Light Magic is capable of something like this?!‚Äù ‚ÄúWith a few tricks, yes.‚ÄÇTo be honest, it‚Äôs more theory than trickery‚Ä¶‚Äù I wonder if he‚Äôd understand it if I try to explain it‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCan you teach me that spell later?!‚Äù Pat is very excited ‚Äî his ears are twitching.‚ÄÇOh,¬†right! He thought Light Magic would be unsuitable for attacking purposes‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try, but I‚Äôm not sure if I can explain it properly‚Ä¶‚ÄÇSo don‚Äôt expect too much!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnything would be great!‚Äù ‚ÄúPatrick! Please calm down!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ sorry.‚ÄÇI got a little excited there,‚Äù he glances to the side and apologizes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt understand why.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs go back!‚Äù We return to the cave.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt know about the others, but after that trip in the rain, I‚Äôm freezing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be somewhere warm again!‚Äù Matt says, ‚Äúbut do you know what‚Äôs best after a trip in the cold rain?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù I answer with a big grin, ‚Äúa hot bath!‚Äù I guess Matt feels the same as I do. ‚ÄúGate: Evergreen Forest!‚Äù, I open a portal to my Magic Space, ‚Äúsince I knew Kat and Luna would be coming, I‚Äôve added the second bath in the Evergreen Forest.‚ÄÇI also added changing rooms.‚ÄÇWe can enjoy this artificial hot spring all at the same time!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat answers, ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt you dare peek!‚Äù Everyone but me goes to their room and gets some change of clothes.‚ÄÇAs they return, we enter my Magic Space. Silas looks around, ‚Äúthe trees have grown.‚ÄÇIt seems the plants are growing well.‚ÄÇDo you still use magic to speed up their growth?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I do.‚ÄÇThough, I‚Äôm taking it slowly.‚ÄÇI only make them grow a bit after adding more fertilizer to the soil.‚ÄÇI can feel the trees are healthy.‚ÄÇSo I think it‚Äôs the right approach.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ an orchard surrounded by trees?‚Äù Alexander exclaims, ‚Äúyou called it Evergreen Forest ‚Äî it‚Äôs a very appropriate name.‚Äù We split up, go to the changing area, undress and enter the bath. ‚ÄúAhh‚Ä¶ This feels nice!‚Äù Pat exclaims. ‚ÄúThis bath feels even better than the one the palace, don‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù Matt says. ‚ÄúI concur,‚Äù I hear Kat answering, ‚Äúthis feels more invigorating than the bath at the palace.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it alright not to have someone on watch duty?‚Äù Alexander asks. ‚ÄúSain said it‚Äôs OK.‚ÄÇApparently, Magic Spaces can‚Äôt be entered without the explicit trust of the owner.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the only danger is being ambushed when leaving the space?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†but I‚Äôm sure they will be able to manage.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo basically, we should bring our gear here as well, just to be sure,‚Äù Matt adds. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be best,‚Äù Alexander answers. ‚ÄúThough if you have the money to spare, you could also just have a spare set of gear stored here,‚Äù I add, ‚Äúthat or give them to me so I can put them in my Infinite Storage.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†right, you do have Infinite Storage‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúhaving you with us makes things so easy.‚ÄÇIt feels like cheating‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you do feel like that why don‚Äôt adjust your aims accordingly?‚Äù Alexander suggests. ‚ÄúYour aims?‚Äù, I ask. ‚ÄúUsually, I would just aim to get a Gold rank,‚Äù Matt explains, ‚ÄúMaybe we should aim for Mithril‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúGold? Mithril?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†right, you didn‚Äôt receive an explanation on how guild ranks work.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me explain then,‚Äù Alexander adds, ‚Äúthere are 1X () ranks.‚ÄÇThe lowest rank is Bronze-X ().‚ÄÇFrom there, you promote through Bronze-10 () up to Bronze-5.‚ÄÇAfter that, you promote through Silver-4 up to Silver-1.‚ÄÇAfter that, the ranks are Gold-1 to Gold-3.‚ÄÇAnd after that, the ranks are Mithril-4 to Mithril-6 to Orihalcum-7 to Orihalcum-E (), then finally, there‚Äôs Black-10 ().‚ÄÇOrihalcum and higher ranks are very rarely ever issued.‚ÄÇThe reason the numbers meet in the middle is starting with Gold ranks, adventurers are considered having a stable income. Usually, royals that become adventurers for a while when coming of age, aim for a Gold rank to prove they can make a stable income as an adventurer.‚ÄÇBut there is no rule that says it has to be the goal, you can always aim lower or higher.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù So ignoring the numbers, the ranks go from Bronze to Silver to Gold to Mithril to Orihalcum and then to Black. After soaking in the bath for a while, we return to the cave. ‚ÄúI forgot to ask, but are you okay with eating raw fish?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúRaw fish? Isn‚Äôt that risky?‚ÄÇSometimes people become ill after eating raw fish,‚Äù Kat answers, ‚Äúthough I‚Äôve heard there are some people who like to eat it that way‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 42: Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain"> Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-03-09, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/NotKeoni#1327" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">notKeoni</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Lesson in Lock Picking" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/41-lesson-in-lock-picking/">Lesson in Lock Picking</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Rice and Real Rice" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/43-rice-and-real-rice/">Rice and Real Rice</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>A while later, the rain has noticeably calmed down.</p> <p>‚ÄúI think we should move soon,‚Äù I tell the others.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhere are we going to?‚Äù Kat asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe forest, somewhere in the southern parts,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt guarantee it, but if you‚Äôre lucky, you get to see something special.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf Swift says it‚Äôs something special, it must be something truly special!‚Äù Matt jokes.</p> <p>The group puts on their rainwear and we leave the cave.‚ÄÇWe walk through the forest to the southern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs nothing at the location where I found the Sky Salmon.‚ÄÇWe continue strolling around.‚ÄÇEventually, we encounter a school of tuna flying in the air near the ground.</p> <p>‚ÄúSky Tuna?!‚Äù even Luna seems to seem shocked.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs Sky Tuna this time‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumble.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis time?!‚Äù Katherine asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy are you disappointed?!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs Sky Fish!‚Äù Matt asks, ‚ÄúThey are rarely ever seen!‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never seen any kind of those‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNeither have I‚Ä¶‚Äù Luna adds.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo this is where you got them‚Ä¶‚Äù Patrick mumbles.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†last time, I encountered a school of Sky Salmon.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not such a fan of tuna‚Ä¶‚Äù I mutter.</p> <p>I think a dozen or so should be plenty.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs shoot only a few at a time.</p> <p><em>‚ÄúLaser!

Please calm down!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ sorry.‚ÄÇI got a little excited there,‚Äù he glances to the side and apologizes.</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt understand why.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs go back!‚Äù</p> <p>We return to the cave.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt know about the others, but after that trip in the rain, I‚Äôm freezing.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be somewhere warm again!‚Äù Matt says, ‚Äúbut do you know what‚Äôs best after a trip in the cold rain?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù I answer with a big grin, ‚Äúa hot bath!‚Äù</p> <p>I guess Matt feels the same as I do.</p> <p>‚Äú<em>Gate: Evergreen Forest!</em>‚Äù, I open a portal to my Magic Space, ‚Äúsince I knew Kat and Luna would be coming, I‚Äôve added the second bath in the Evergreen Forest.‚ÄÇI also added changing rooms.‚ÄÇWe can enjoy this artificial hot spring all at the same time!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat answers, ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt you dare peek!‚Äù</p> <p>Everyone but me goes to their room and gets some change of clothes.‚ÄÇAs they return, we enter my Magic Space.</p> <p>Silas looks around, ‚Äúthe trees have grown.‚ÄÇIt seems the plants are growing well.‚ÄÇDo you still use magic to speed up their growth?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†I do.‚ÄÇThough, I‚Äôm taking it slowly.‚ÄÇI only make them grow a bit after adding more fertilizer to the soil.‚ÄÇI can feel the trees are healthy.‚ÄÇSo I think it‚Äôs the right approach.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ an orchard surrounded by trees?‚Äù Alexander exclaims, ‚Äúyou called it Evergreen Forest ‚Äî it‚Äôs a very appropriate name.‚Äù</p> <p>We split up, go to the changing area, undress and enter the bath.</p> <p>‚ÄúAhh‚Ä¶ This feels nice!‚Äù Pat exclaims.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis bath feels even better than the one the palace, don‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI concur,‚Äù I hear Kat answering, ‚Äúthis feels more invigorating than the bath at the palace.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIs it alright not to have someone on watch duty?‚Äù Alexander asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúSain said it‚Äôs OK.‚ÄÇApparently, Magic Spaces can‚Äôt be entered without the explicit trust of the owner.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo the only danger is being ambushed when leaving the space?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†but I‚Äôm sure they will be able to manage.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo basically, we should bring our gear here as well, just to be sure,‚Äù Matt adds.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be best,‚Äù Alexander answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúThough if you have the money to spare, you could also just have a spare set of gear stored here,‚Äù I add, ‚Äúthat or give them to me so I can put them in my Infinite Storage.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†right, you do have Infinite Storage‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúhaving you with us makes things so easy.‚ÄÇIt feels like cheating‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf you do feel like that why don‚Äôt adjust your aims accordingly?‚Äù Alexander suggests.</p> <p>‚ÄúYour aims?‚Äù, I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúUsually, I would just aim to get a Gold rank,‚Äù Matt explains, ‚ÄúMaybe we should aim for Mithril‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúGold? Mithril?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†right, you didn‚Äôt receive an explanation on how guild ranks work.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLet me explain then,‚Äù Alexander adds, ‚Äúthere are <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>1X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> ranks.‚ÄÇThe lowest rank is Bronze-<ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.‚ÄÇFrom there, you promote through Bronze-<ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>10</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> up to Bronze-5.‚ÄÇAfter that, you promote through Silver-4 up to Silver-1.‚ÄÇAfter that, the ranks are Gold-1 to Gold-3.‚ÄÇAnd after that, the ranks are Mithril-4 to Mithril-6 to Orihalcum-7 to Orihalcum-<ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>E</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, then finally, there‚Äôs Black-<ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label=""><rb>10</rb><rp> (</rp><rt></rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.‚ÄÇOrihalcum and higher ranks are very rarely ever issued.‚ÄÇThe reason the numbers meet in the middle is starting with Gold ranks, adventurers are considered having a stable income.</p> <p>Usually, royals that become adventurers for a while when coming of age, aim for a Gold rank to prove they can make a stable income as an adventurer.‚ÄÇBut there is no rule that says it has to be the goal, you can always aim lower or higher.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>So ignoring the numbers, the ranks go from Bronze to Silver to Gold to Mithril to Orihalcum and then to Black.</p> <p>After soaking in the bath for a while, we return to the cave.</p> <p>‚ÄúI forgot to ask, but are you okay with eating raw fish?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúRaw fish? Isn‚Äôt that risky?‚ÄÇSometimes people become ill after eating raw fish,‚Äù Kat answers, ‚Äúthough I‚Äôve heard there are some people who like to eat it that way‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Lesson in Lock Picking" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/41-lesson-in-lock-picking/">Lesson in Lock Picking</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Rice and Real Rice" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/43-rice-and-real-rice/">Rice and Real Rice</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-mt-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
