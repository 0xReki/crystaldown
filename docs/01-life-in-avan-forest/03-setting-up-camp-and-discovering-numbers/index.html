I look around to trying to find a suitable camping space.‚ÄÇI spot a cliff. It‚Äôs at least four or five times my height.‚ÄÇI walk there to get a closer look.‚ÄÇThe area around the cliff is free of debris.‚ÄÇThis seems like a good place for a camp.‚ÄÇI use the Box of Camping Utilities. The box contains parts for a fly tent, some blankets, some tinder, some Barrier Crystals and several rolls of toilet paper.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no water again, but I got some toilet paper instead‚Ä¶‚ÄÇWell, it‚Äôs not a problem since there‚Äôs a source of clean water nearby.‚ÄÇApart from the tent parts, I put everything else into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇI set up the tent, or at least I try to. Fly tents are very simplistic.‚ÄÇSo I thought it‚Äôd be very quick to set up.‚ÄÇBut my limbs aren‚Äôt moving where I want them to move!‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt have any hand-eye coordination with this body.‚ÄÇSo this is what they meant about getting used to my new body.‚ÄÇAfter way too long than I dare to admit, I finally succeed in setting up the tent.‚ÄÇGood thing it‚Äôs only a fly tent.‚ÄÇIf this were a more complex tent, it might have taken me till dusk to set it up! So now I need to set up a campfire.‚ÄÇBut how do I do that?‚ÄÇEvery time I‚Äôve been camping so far it has been either in someone‚Äôs backyard or someone else has taken care of it.‚ÄÇFor now, I have to be content with having what I currently have.‚ÄÇRushing it would probably simply result in injuring myself.‚ÄÇBesides, it‚Äôs not that urgent, since I have 30 Lottery Boxes of Food in my Infinite Storage. From the position of the sun, I guess it should be about noon.‚ÄÇLooking at my interface, it says it‚Äôs 0E:5X. 0E:5X?‚ÄÇNow it‚Äôs 0E:5E.‚ÄÇWhat on earth is going on here?‚ÄÇI wait for the clock to change again.‚ÄÇNow it‚Äôs 10:00.‚ÄÇAre the numbers different here?‚ÄÇI remember receiving 30 Lottery Boxes of Food.‚ÄÇI take them all out from my Infinite Storage and start counting them. ‚ÄúOne, two, three, four‚Ä¶ thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six.‚Äù So 30 is equivalent to thirty-six.‚ÄÇSo 10 is equivalent to twelve.‚ÄÇThat means my interface uses a base-twelve system.‚ÄÇFrom what I can see, X seems to equate to ten and E to eleven.‚ÄÇIs this how numbers in this world work?‚ÄÇI remember hearing about a base-twelve system in my previous life.‚ÄÇI think it‚Äôs called duodecimal.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs said it would make day-to-day life more manageable since you can divide twelve by two, three, four and six compared to ten, which you can only divide by two and five.‚ÄÇBut since ‚Äúserious‚Äù maths isn‚Äôt affected as much, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it.
