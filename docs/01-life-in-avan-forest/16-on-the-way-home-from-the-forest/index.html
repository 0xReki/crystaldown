forest with ease.‚ÄÇAnd he asked you what skill you want and the one crystal he showed you happened to contain that skill.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a coincidence.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true.‚ÄÇBut unlike what I expect from a keeper.‚ÄÇHe didn‚Äôt seem to have any interest in measuring my worth.‚ÄÇHe had more the vibe of a curious cat.‚Äù That‚Äôs true.‚ÄÇHe seemed to me more like a curious cat.‚ÄÇI was short of inviting him to the castle when he left‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut I didn‚Äôt get the chance to do so.‚ÄÇSeth interjects: ‚ÄúThough I can agree he looked like a curious cat, I believe you just can‚Äôt read

keeper!‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to assume he is.‚ÄÇHe appeared out of nowhere even though we were sure there can‚Äôt be anyone.‚ÄÇEven when we about to attack him he was just calmly standing there as if we were no threat to him at all. You told him your reason why you want the skill.‚ÄÇAnd since you got the exact skill you wanted, it means the keeper agrees with you, meaning you might actually have that skill you claim you have.‚Äù Seth is right, and I‚Äôm happy to receive some confirmation that my skill is real.‚ÄÇBut still‚Ä¶ it feels like a lie to me‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDo what you think is right.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not convinced he is the keeper.‚ÄÇAnyway, keeper or not keeper, I want to give him something for his help.‚ÄÇDo you have any ideas?‚Äù ‚ÄúGiving him a cloak with your personal crest would be most appropriate.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs way too formal‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt think a reclusive person like him would appreciate that.‚Äù This time Silas voiced his opinion: ‚ÄúYoung Master, if you want to be more practical, I think arrows would make a good gift.‚Äù Arrows?‚ÄÇWhy would he need arrows? ‚ÄúWhat makes you say that?‚Äù Sain asks.‚ÄÇLooks like I‚Äôm not the only one that‚Äôs surprised by that suggestion. ‚ÄúHe had a quiver of arrows with him.‚ÄÇThe arrows were quite worn out.‚ÄÇThey were well-used.‚ÄÇMy guess is they are at their limit.‚ÄÇEven if he doesn‚Äôt need them by the time you give them to him, he‚Äôll still find them useful sometime in the future.‚Äù As always, Silas is quite perceptive.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt even notice he had a quiver with him at all! ‚ÄúGreat, can both of those be prepared by the time for the next
