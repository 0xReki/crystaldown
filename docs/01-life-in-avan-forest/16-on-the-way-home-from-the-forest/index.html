has a question on his mind. “What’s up Sain? You seem troubled.” “Nothing…” “Don’t be reserved…” “Then, I’ll just say it. Young Master, do you think that Ailuranthrope boy we’ve just met is the keeper of the Crystal Down?” That boy being the keeper? No, I don’t think so! Though he is intriguing. “Why do you think so?” “Well, he led us through that forest with ease. And he asked you what skill you want and the one crystal he showed you happened to contain that skill. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.” “That’s true. But unlike what I expect from a keeper. He didn’t seem to have any interest in measuring my worth. He had more the vibe of a curious cat.” That’s true. He seemed to me more like a curious cat. I was short of inviting him to the castle when he left… But I didn’t get the chance to do so. Seth interjects: “Though I can agree he looked like a curious cat, I believe you just can’t read the intentions of the keeper even with the skill you supposedly have. I’ll report to your father you received the blessings of the keeper.” Wait, what? “We’re not even sure he’s the keeper!” “We have to assume he is. He appeared out of nowhere even though we were sure there can’t be anyone. Even when we about to attack him he was just calmly standing there as if we were no threat to him at all. You told him your reason why you want the skill. And since you got the exact skill you wanted, it means the keeper agrees with you, meaning you might actually have that skill you claim you have.” Seth is right, and I’m happy to receive some confirmation that my skill is real. But still… it feels like a lie to me… “Do what you think is right. I’m not convinced he is the keeper. Anyway, keeper or not keeper, I want to give him something for his help. Do you have any ideas?” “Giving him a cloak with your personal crest would be most appropriate.” “That’s way too formal… I don’t think a reclusive person like him would appreciate that.” This time Silas voiced his opinion: “Young Master, if you want to be more practical, I think arrows would make a good gift.” Arrows? Why would he need arrows? “What makes you say that?” Sain asks. Looks like I’m not the only one that’s surprised by that suggestion. “He had a quiver of arrows with him. The arrows were quite worn out. They were well-used. My guess is they are at their limit. Even if he doesn’t need them by the time you give them to him, he’ll still find them useful sometime in the future.” As always, Silas is quite perceptive. I didn’t even notice he had a quiver with him at all! “Great, can both of those be prepared by the time for the next outing?” “Yes, we’ll have it taken care of.” “Thanks, I appreciate it.”  " } ] } </script>
