Alfred to fit.‚ÄÇI climb down and touch the wall. ‚ÄúGrind!‚Äù There‚Äôs no need to worry about the cold from outside seeping in.‚ÄÇThe vines that hide the entrance do a good job of isolating warmth.‚ÄÇI should introduce Alfred to my other familiars. ¬´Raiden, Faryl, Felix, come here!‚ÄÇI want to introduce you to a new friend.¬ª Faryl and Felix immediately come from the bedroom.‚ÄÇA moment later Raiden flies in, too.‚ÄÇI try to have him land on my hand with the falconry glove.‚ÄÇHe lands without any problems. ¬´How is the glove, Raiden?¬ª ¬´This is much better than landing on master‚Äôs head.¬ª ¬´This is Alfred!‚ÄÇAlfred, meet Raiden, Faryl and Felix.‚ÄÇPlease get along!¬ª I hear a ringing sound ‚Äî it‚Äôs another mail!‚ÄÇI open the mail. Mail Sender: Suscellu Subject: Next Meeting Tonight I know this is somewhat last minute, but the next meeting is tonight.‚ÄÇThere will be more gods coming today.‚ÄÇSee you tonight. Regards, Suscellu There will be more gods tonight?‚ÄÇI guess I need more food then!‚ÄÇI have some boar on me.‚ÄÇI guess I‚Äôll make some Schnitzel then.‚ÄÇIf I had some sparkling water, I could make Tonkatsu.‚ÄÇThe only difference between Schnitzel and Tonkatsu is the fluffiness of the breading.‚ÄÇMaybe what you have on the side counts as well‚Ä¶ Anyway, I have some leeway in my finances and stock-keeping so I make my breading from Panko, crushed dried bread without bread crusts to get it more fluffy.‚ÄÇI still fry them in a pan, though.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll bother with deep-frying when I can get my hands on some fizzy water.‚ÄÇThis time, the Schnitzel end up more fluffy, but they‚Äôre still not anywhere as fluffy enough for me to call them Tonkatsu. Fruit Jelly is perfect as it is now.‚ÄÇI might be able to improve it with some vanilla sauce.‚ÄÇDo they even consume milk in this world?‚ÄÇIf yes, can I consume it?‚ÄÇI mean, this is a new body!‚ÄÇSo the lactose intolerance of my old body won‚Äôt affect me, will it?‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt have any vanilla on me, so I make the Fruit Jelly like before.‚ÄÇWhile waiting for the Jelly to set, I make some more fries.‚ÄÇOn second thought, I want to be able to eat it cold too, so I‚Äôll make Croquettes instead.‚ÄÇI can just use the extra breadcrumbs I have from making Schnitzel. As the Jelly has finished setting, I put everything into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇTime to go to bed!‚ÄÇWhen my consciousness returns I‚Äôm back in the while void where I met the gods the last time. ‚ÄúGood evening!‚Äù I hear Suscellu‚Äôs voice greeting me.‚ÄÇI turn around and only see Suscellu.‚ÄÇI wonder where the others are‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúGood evening! Am I too early?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, you aren‚Äôt ‚Äî I just wanted to talk with you in private before the others arrive.‚ÄÇYou see, you have been placed under my jurisdiction.‚ÄÇSo I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need.‚ÄÇAfter all, there aren‚Äôt that many people exclusively in my domain.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot many people? How come? Aren‚Äôt you the Deity of Nature and Wine?‚Äù ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt tell you about the mortal problems, but this time I might as well tell you.‚ÄÇA few days ago, you were told about the Order of Light, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúWell, in short, they didn‚Äôt only kill the followers of the Faith.‚ÄÇThey massacred followers of every other deity.‚ÄÇThey even tried killing my followers, the folk that used to grow Huffin.‚ÄÇAll of Krale was made to follow the Order.‚ÄÇWell, not entirely‚Ä¶‚ÄÇOne small village of indomitable followers of Earth‚Äôs Bounty holds out against that invasive religion.‚Äù ‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs Bounty?‚ÄÇDo they have a secret potion?‚ÄÇLike one that gives you superhuman strength?‚Äù ‚ÄúSuperhuman strength?‚ÄÇNo, that potion doesn‚Äôt to that.‚ÄÇThose potions are taboo, anyway.‚ÄÇHowever, if you use that secret potion after harvesting, plants will turn back to the budding stage.‚ÄÇIf used correctly, you can double the yield of certain crops.‚ÄÇNot all plants can take advantage of that, of course.‚ÄÇThat potion is a well-kept secret of the followers of Earth‚Äôs Bounty.‚ÄÇIt could be used to ruin the harvest, too. The only reason they haven‚Äôt been attacked yet is Krale currently valuing the high yield of crops that the village provides.‚ÄÇThough I fear that might change sometime soon.‚ÄÇAnd when that happens, we need to help, too.‚ÄÇOh, by the way, the followers of Earth‚Äôs Bounty both worship Clayah and me as their guardian deities.‚ÄÇThey have a special connection to us so we can intervene more freely.‚ÄÇBut if we intervene through you, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to help.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôll do what I can.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor now, just get a few more familiars,‚Äù a female voice answers instead of Suscellu.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs Clayah.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúAre you sure it‚Äôs not going to a problem with telling him so much?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù an unfamiliar voice answers.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a robed person.‚ÄÇI can‚Äôt tell what race or gender they are.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a question of if there is a need for intervention, but when.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs better for us if he knows about it so he can intervene for us,‚Äù They turn to me. ‚ÄúHow do you do?‚ÄÇI‚Äôm Ukota.‚ÄÇMy domain is Time and Fate.‚Äù ‚ÄúPleased to meet you,‚Äù I really want to know how they look and so on‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs rude to ask! ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to ask?‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh? No, it‚Äôs rude.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I agree, it‚Äôs rude.‚ÄÇThe ones before you didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rude and blatantly asked.‚ÄÇI hated them.‚ÄÇI like your attitude.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll tell you: I don‚Äôt have a form below this robe.‚ÄÇI just have this robe for the convenience of others.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh!‚ÄÇLooks like I made it on time!‚Äù another voice says.‚ÄÇIt sounds like a young man.‚ÄÇI look in the direction of the voice.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a Dwarf with a beard and all.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt care much about beards, but hisbeard has some kind of awesome vibe to it.‚ÄÇHe turns to me.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúHowdy! I‚Äôm Rhygni, the deity of Cooking and Forging.‚ÄÇPleased to meet ya!‚ÄÇI heard you made delicious food, so I decided to drop by.‚Äù ‚ÄúPleased to meet you.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince everyone is here, let‚Äôs start!‚Äù Suscellu announces.
