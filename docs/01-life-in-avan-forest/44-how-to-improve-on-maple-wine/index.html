Again silence. ‚ÄúBut I have,‚Äù Pat finally breaks the silence.‚ÄÇEveryone turns their head towards Pat,¬†‚Äúit‚Äôs an ingredient you commonly find in Ganesqua.‚Äù ‚ÄúGanesqua‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt your mother from there?‚Äù Kat asks. ‚ÄúYes,¬†she is.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm surprised you remember.‚ÄÇAnyway, there are two different kinds of shrubs whose sap is used as a condiment.‚ÄÇThey are both salty but taste somewhat different.‚ÄÇMy mother tells me she prefers Numa.‚ÄÇIt has a taste reminiscent of fish.‚ÄÇThough she refrains from eating it when she has to meet people the day after.‚ÄÇIt gives you quite a smelly breath for a while.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it the smell of rotten fish? How long does the smell last?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúNo,¬†it‚Äôs more like rotten eggs. And you tend to have that smelly breath for about a day.‚Äù The sap of that shrub sounds like quite like fish sauce.‚ÄÇBut it sounds like it has the same smelly after effect as garlic.‚ÄÇFish sauce with the smell of garlic.‚ÄÇI wonder if it has the taste of garlic, too? ‚ÄúI see. So‚Ä¶ can I buy these in the capital?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou want some? I don‚Äôt know where to get it in the capital,‚Äù Alexander answers, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôd look for Snak.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Snack?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†Snak, the wandering Dwarven merchant.‚ÄÇThey say he specializes in more exotic groceries.‚ÄÇHe might carry it from time to time.‚ÄÇThough I don‚Äôt know when he‚Äôs in town next time.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not exactly a regular‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you mean Snakkonlir by any chance?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†that‚Äôs him.

It‚Äôs just Sashimi, Sushi and Maki Rolls! Nothing much to foodgasm about‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis dish brings out the light tastes of the ingredients.‚ÄÇThis is a pleasant sensation‚Äù, Luna calmly says.‚ÄÇShe‚Äôs as emotionless as ever.‚ÄÇEven though her reaction is more in line with the one I was expecting, it still feels to me like she‚Äôs exaggerating. ‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù Silas and Matt nod with a smile of satisfaction.‚ÄÇThey are awfully calm.‚ÄÇToo calm‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt seems I was right to brace myself for something as delicious as this,‚Äù Matt adds, ‚Äúeven so, I‚Äôm surprised how good this is!‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†this is even better than the dish we got last time,‚Äù Silas responds. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exaggerating‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumble. I notice one of the Slimes crawling on the table.‚ÄÇI think this is the one that likes to drink wine. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? You want some wine?‚Äù I ask even though I know it will definitely not answer.‚ÄÇNone of my Slimes have been answering in Telepathy until now.‚ÄÇUsually, they just act for an answer or convey some feeling.‚ÄÇThe slime stretches out part of its body like a tentacle and grabs some Sashimi to eat.‚ÄÇI can feel it radiating happiness towards me. ‚ÄúThis is a first!‚ÄÇThat one only joins me when I drink wine.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never seen it eat anything else.‚ÄÇIt seems to like the Sashimi.‚ÄÇThat being said: I guess this does go well with some wine.‚Äù I get several bottles of Maple Wine as well as several cups from my Infinite Storage. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we have a drink?‚Äù I ask. Everybody present nods.‚ÄÇI pour a cup of wine for everyone, including the Slime. ‚ÄúSo this is the Maple Wine I was told about,‚Äù Alexander says.‚ÄÇHe takes a sip, ‚Äúit‚Äôs good.‚ÄÇI hear you still find it lacking.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I do. But I can‚Äôt put my finger on what exactly the problem is.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm,¬†how about‚Ä¶ No,¬†that‚Äôs impossible to pull off!‚Äù It seems Alexander has an idea.‚ÄÇBut he‚Äôs dismissing it right from the get-go.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth pursuing. ‚ÄúPlease do elaborate!‚Äù Matt wants to know it, anyway, ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt it you who thought me dismissing ideas outright without sharing it with others it is not a good practice?‚ÄÇAfter all, there might be a way to do it after all!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. Here‚Äôs a thought: how about making ale instead of wine?‚Äù ‚ÄúAle?‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI see that might be an improvement.‚ÄÇWhere‚Äôs the problem with that?‚Äù ‚ÄúFor Ale,¬†you‚Äôd need Huffin.‚ÄÇBut that doesn‚Äôt grow here. Krale Kingdom grows them.‚ÄÇBut they‚Äôre have prohibited the export of Huffin.‚ÄÇI wouldn‚Äôt dare to try to smuggle it here.‚ÄÇRelations are already strained.‚Äù Politics‚Ä¶ Meh‚Ä¶‚ÄÇGood thing I‚Äôm sworn to neutrality.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôd be quite bothersome if a war was to break out. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù Matt tries to calm me down.‚ÄÇHe explains: ‚ÄúNeither Krale nor Sitnalta would be able to properly wage war.‚ÄÇRaising a sea fleet in an inland sea would be a waste of resources.‚ÄÇInstead, both sides have their observers posted.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs only a ferry between the two countries.‚ÄÇThat ferry is run by the Merchants‚Äô Guilds of both countries.‚ÄÇAnd climbing the mountains for an attack is way too dangerous!‚ÄÇThe worst case is a trade war, and that‚Äôs would just be an inconvenience to both sides at worst.‚ÄÇNot even that. It‚Äôs not like we have a lot of trade at all with them at all.‚ÄÇAs a matter of fact, the ferry service is unable to earn its own keep.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs being subsidized by both countries.‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 44: How to Improve on Maple Wine"> How to Improve on Maple Wine </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-04-28, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Rice and Real Rice" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/43-rice-and-real-rice/">Rice and Real Rice</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Divine Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/45-divine-problems/">Divine Problems Transcending Realms</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs made from the sap of a shrub called Xitu.‚Äù</p> <p>Awkward silence.

Here‚Äôs a thought: how about making ale instead of wine?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAle?‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI see that might be an improvement.‚ÄÇWhere‚Äôs the problem with that?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúFor Ale,¬†you‚Äôd need Huffin.‚ÄÇBut that doesn‚Äôt grow here. Krale Kingdom grows them.‚ÄÇBut they‚Äôre have prohibited the export of Huffin.‚ÄÇI wouldn‚Äôt dare to try to smuggle it here.‚ÄÇRelations are already strained.‚Äù</p> <p>Politics‚Ä¶ Meh‚Ä¶‚ÄÇGood thing I‚Äôm sworn to neutrality.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôd be quite bothersome if a war was to break out.</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù Matt tries to calm me down.‚ÄÇHe explains: ‚ÄúNeither Krale nor Sitnalta would be able to properly wage war.‚ÄÇRaising a sea fleet in an inland sea would be a waste of resources.‚ÄÇInstead, both sides have their observers posted.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs only a ferry between the two countries.‚ÄÇThat ferry is run by the Merchants‚Äô Guilds of both countries.‚ÄÇAnd climbing the mountains for an attack is way too dangerous!‚ÄÇThe worst case is a trade war, and that‚Äôs would just be an inconvenience to both sides at worst.‚ÄÇNot even that. It‚Äôs not like we have a lot of trade at all with them at all.‚ÄÇAs a matter of fact, the ferry service is unable to earn its own keep.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs being subsidized by both countries.‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Rice and Real Rice" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/43-rice-and-real-rice/">Rice and Real Rice</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Divine Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/45-divine-problems/">Divine Problems Transcending Realms</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="qu·ªëc Th√°i ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">qu·ªëc Th√°i ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
