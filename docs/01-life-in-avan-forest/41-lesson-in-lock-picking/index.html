Matt‚Äôs group arrives.‚ÄÇI stay in bed and continue sleeping.‚ÄÇA while later I wake up.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs 8:4X (eight bells four-do-el) I should get up.‚ÄÇI still feel sleepy ‚Äî maybe a hot bath will wake me up.‚ÄÇI make my way to the bath and reach out to the plug so I can fill the tub.‚ÄÇAt least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do as I get a burst of hot water into my face. Well, at least now I‚Äôm awake‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI look down at the direction where the water came from.‚ÄÇThe Hot Springs Slimes are there.‚ÄÇThey radiate a feeling of panic.‚ÄÇWhat happened?‚ÄÇThe Slimes slowly move out of the way.‚ÄÇI can see one of them looks as if something has bitten off part of it.‚ÄÇDid I accidentally step on one of them? ¬´I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll be more careful! Are you OK?¬ª I carefully caress the damaged Slime.‚ÄÇBesides the damage, it seems to be alright.‚ÄÇI could be imagining it, but I think it‚Äôs already filling up the missing part.‚ÄÇThe Slimes finally calm down.‚ÄÇAfter bathing, I get dressed and leave the cave and wait for Matt‚Äôs group.‚ÄÇThey‚Äôre not here yet.‚ÄÇShortly after X:00 (ten bells), they arrive. ‚ÄúGood morning, everyone!‚ÄÇWelcome to my place,‚Äù I greet everyone. As expected, Matt has Kat,¬†Pat and Luna with him.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs also Alexander and Silas with them. ‚ÄúGood morning, Swift!‚Äù Matt greets me, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre awake!‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I am,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúat least, I am now.‚ÄÇI almost crushed one of my Slimes while being half-asleep.‚ÄÇGood thing the other Slimes stopped me before it got critical!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh no! Is it terribly hurt?‚Äù Kat asks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good now.‚Äù I call the Hot Springs Slimes over.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no Slime with visible damage anymore.‚ÄÇSo it did recover!‚ÄÇBut there‚Äôs one that is notably smaller than the others. ‚ÄúI think the smaller one is the one I stepped on.‚ÄÇAm I right?‚Äù As an answer, it gently spouts water around. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre alright.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs go inside so you can prepare your rooms.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù Matt hands me a package, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs some paper and tools to practice writing.‚ÄÇAnd some books, too.‚ÄÇAmong those, there‚Äôs a copy of the Encyclopedia Magicka.‚ÄÇI heard you were interested in that.‚Äù My own copy of the Encyclopedia Magicka? Neat! ‚ÄúThanks a lot, I really appreciate it.‚Äù We go into the cave and I show them around.‚ÄÇWhile the others are preparing their rooms, I unpack the package and put the contents into my Infinite Storage. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it too dark in here?‚Äù Kat asks. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind it that much,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúbesides, there‚Äôs this.‚Äù I open the lid to my Light Crystal in the wall. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a crystal as a light source in the wall.‚ÄÇOh‚Ä¶ it seems I completely forgot to look for another one for the new room.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll add that later.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, I‚Äôm not a diva!‚ÄÇThough I‚Äôd really appreciate that.‚ÄÇThough I have to say, this light feels nice.‚ÄÇUnlike typical magic light, it feels completely natural.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know this glow!‚Äù Matt interjects, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt I get the Light Magic Skill from one of those?!‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†you did,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve put this one into the cave before you turned up the first time.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can move them?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs easy.‚Äù ‚ÄúStop, we don‚Äôt want to hear it!‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no need to spill your secrets as the keeper!‚Äù Matt stops me. ‚ÄúThose crystals are said to be immovable!‚Äù Kat explains. ‚ÄúI think I should read up on the myths of the world‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYou really should,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúthere should be enough material in the library.‚ÄÇBut enough of that. Let‚Äôs start training!‚ÄÇUnless there another hunt we have to take care of‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúHaha! What are the odds of that happening?‚Äù Silence. I don‚Äôt receive a message. That‚Äôs great! ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think the birds are quite noisy?‚Äù Kat asks. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I think it‚Äôs just because we‚Äôre here in the forest,‚Äù Matt answers. ‚ÄúNo,¬†now that you mention it, they are noisier than usual.‚ÄÇI think it‚Äôll rain soon,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúdo you guys have rainproof clothes?‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs something I want to check during the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†we do. What are you planning?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúSomething special,‚Äù I answer grinning, ‚ÄúYou can look forward to it.‚Äù Silence.‚ÄÇEven the birds have fallen silent.‚ÄÇAfter a short moment, it starts pouring.‚ÄÇEven in the cave, you can hear the rain quite loudly and clearly. ‚ÄúWell, so much about training today‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas sighs, ‚ÄúWell, I have something for you.‚Äù He gives me a bag. I open the bag and have a look inside. There are bits of metal inside. ‚ÄúWhat are these?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúThose are lock picks,‚Äù he answers.‚ÄÇUpon seeing my confusion, he continues: ‚ÄúOther uses aside.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs quite a handy skill for dungeons.‚ÄÇSome treasure chests there are locked.‚Äù He takes out a padlock and a key and hands them to me. He also puts several other items on the table. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a lock for you to practise. I‚Äôve more if the others want to have a shot at a lesson lock picking.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù the girls answer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old for that business,‚Äù Alexander answers.‚ÄÇHe and the girls start talking about various things.‚ÄÇMatt and Pat on the other hand are very open to trying it out. I examine the lock.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a simple design.‚ÄÇSilas takes out another pair and demonstrates how to use the picks. ‚ÄúThis is a very basic design, I mean a cheap copy of one.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs basically just an illusion of a lock.‚ÄÇSadly, there are some people that sell this.‚ÄÇAll you need to do is turn the mechanism.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs useless as a real lock, but it‚Äôs a great tool to illustrate the process. The ones I gave you are real ones.‚ÄÇThey have some wards for more security.‚ÄÇBut still, all you need to do is turn the mechanism.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just more fiddly.‚Äù I take a pick and fiddle around with the lock a bit.‚ÄÇAfter several seconds, I manage to open the padlock. ‚ÄúLike this?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†like that.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs take it up a notch.‚Äù Silas gives me another padlock. ‚ÄúHmm,¬†this is harder than it looks,‚Äù Matt says. ‚ÄúOh,¬†I think I broke the pick,‚Äù Pat shows us a completely bent piece of metal. Instead of picking the lock I just got from Silas, I pick up a sturdy-looking box Silas put on the table.‚ÄÇIt looks somewhat like a safe.‚ÄÇBut it seems like it‚Äôs made of very thin metal.‚ÄÇIf it were thick metal, there wouldn‚Äôt be any space inside. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs this?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lock-picking challenge that‚Äôs being distributed by a locksmith in the capital,‚Äù Silas answers, ‚Äúthe locksmith promises a prize to whoever can open these.‚ÄÇThe boxes are sturdy since they‚Äôre made from Mithril.‚ÄÇThe contents of the vials inside decompose if someone forcefully melts through the metal.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre there any other restrictions?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†but this is still way too hard for you.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet me try something I have an idea‚Ä¶‚Äù I imagine the lock opening.‚ÄÇAll that needs to happen is the lock mechanism to turn. ‚ÄúUnlock!‚Äù I can hear a click.‚ÄÇI open the door of the safe.‚ÄÇThere are two vials that touch the walls, connected by a stone contraption.‚ÄÇThe stone looks like a very brittle mineral.‚ÄÇThe contraption is exactly the size, so it doesn‚Äôt bump around in the safe when transporting it.‚ÄÇThe walls of the safe are a little thicker than I assumed, but still not even half as thick as I would expect from a safe.‚ÄÇI look at Silas. He shakes his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of magic that can pick locks, but I‚Äôve never seen it.‚ÄÇWhere did you learn that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI just tried it out.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt know if it would work.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou should meet the locksmith and demonstrate the spell,‚Äù Silas whispers, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see his face when you show that to him.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù I whisper back. ‚ÄúI think I should be saying something about this,‚Äù Matt interjects, ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs keep it at this: don‚Äôt introduce him to unsavoury folks.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, that person is very reputable.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have to take your word for it‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 41: Lesson in Lock Picking"> Lesson in Lock Picking </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-03-06, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/jayfeather#2293" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">jayfeather</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" A Short Chapter Where (Almost) Nothing Happens" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/40-a-short-chapter-where-almost-nothing-happens/">A Short Chapter Where (Almost) Nothing Happens</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/42-hot-spring-after-a-trip-in-the-rain/">Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>I wake up at about <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label="half past seven"><rb>7:30</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>half past seven</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.‚ÄÇI should still have some time until Matt‚Äôs group arrives.‚ÄÇI stay in bed and continue sleeping.‚ÄÇA while later I wake up.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label="eight bells four-do-el"><rb>8:4X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>eight bells four-do-el</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> I should get up.‚ÄÇI still feel sleepy ‚Äî maybe a hot bath will wake me up.‚ÄÇI make my way to the bath and reach out to the plug so I can fill the tub.‚ÄÇAt least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do as I get a burst of hot water into my face.</p> <p>Well, at least now I‚Äôm awake‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI look down at the direction where the water came from.‚ÄÇThe Hot Springs Slimes are there.‚ÄÇThey radiate a feeling of panic.‚ÄÇWhat happened?‚ÄÇThe Slimes slowly move out of the way.‚ÄÇI can see one of them looks as if something has bitten off part of it.‚ÄÇDid I accidentally step on one of them?</p> <p><em>¬´I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôll be more careful!

Neat!</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks a lot, I really appreciate it.‚Äù</p> <p>We go into the cave and I show them around.‚ÄÇWhile the others are preparing their rooms, I unpack the package and put the contents into my Infinite Storage.</p> <p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it too dark in here?‚Äù Kat asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind it that much,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúbesides, there‚Äôs this.‚Äù</p> <p>I open the lid to my Light Crystal in the wall.</p> <p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a crystal as a light source in the wall.‚ÄÇOh‚Ä¶ it seems I completely forgot to look for another one for the new room.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll add that later.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, I‚Äôm not a diva!‚ÄÇThough I‚Äôd really appreciate that.‚ÄÇThough I have to say, this light feels nice.‚ÄÇUnlike typical magic light, it feels completely natural.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI know this glow!‚Äù Matt interjects, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt I get the Light Magic Skill from one of those?!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†you did,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve put this one into the cave before you turned up the first time.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou can move them?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs easy.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúStop, we don‚Äôt want to hear it!‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no need to spill your secrets as the keeper!‚Äù Matt stops me.</p> <p>‚ÄúThose crystals are said to be immovable!‚Äù Kat explains.</p> <p>‚ÄúI think I should read up on the myths of the world‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou really should,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúthere should be enough material in the library.‚ÄÇBut enough of that. Let‚Äôs start training!‚ÄÇUnless there another hunt we have to take care of‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHaha! What are the odds of that happening?‚Äù</p> <p>Silence. I don‚Äôt receive a message. That‚Äôs great!</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think the birds are quite noisy?‚Äù Kat asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúAre you sure? I think it‚Äôs just because we‚Äôre here in the forest,‚Äù Matt answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†now that you mention it, they are noisier than usual.‚ÄÇI think it‚Äôll rain soon,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúdo you guys have rainproof clothes?‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs something I want to check during the rain.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†we do. What are you planning?‚Äù Matt asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúSomething special,‚Äù I answer grinning, ‚ÄúYou can look forward to it.‚Äù</p> <p>Silence.‚ÄÇEven the birds have fallen silent.‚ÄÇAfter a short moment, it starts pouring.‚ÄÇEven in the cave, you can hear the rain quite loudly and clearly.</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, so much about training today‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas sighs, ‚ÄúWell, I have something for you.‚Äù</p> <p>He gives me a bag. I open the bag and have a look inside. There are bits of metal inside.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat are these?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúThose are lock picks,‚Äù he answers.‚ÄÇUpon seeing my confusion, he continues: ‚ÄúOther uses aside.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs quite a handy skill for dungeons.‚ÄÇSome treasure chests there are locked.‚Äù</p> <p>He takes out a padlock and a key and hands them to me. He also puts several other items on the table.</p> <p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a lock for you to practise. I‚Äôve more if the others want to have a shot at a lesson lock picking.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù the girls answer.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old for that business,‚Äù Alexander answers.‚ÄÇHe and the girls start talking about various things.‚ÄÇMatt and Pat on the other hand are very open to trying it out.</p> <p>I examine the lock.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a simple design.‚ÄÇSilas takes out another pair and demonstrates how to use the picks.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis is a very basic design, I mean a cheap copy of one.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs basically just an illusion of a lock.‚ÄÇSadly, there are some people that sell this.‚ÄÇAll you need to do is turn the mechanism.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs useless as a real lock, but it‚Äôs a great tool to illustrate the process.</p> <p>The ones I gave you are real ones.‚ÄÇThey have some wards for more security.‚ÄÇBut still, all you need to do is turn the mechanism.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just more fiddly.‚Äù</p> <p>I take a pick and fiddle around with the lock a bit.‚ÄÇAfter several seconds, I manage to open the padlock.</p> <p>‚ÄúLike this?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†like that.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs take it up a notch.‚Äù</p> <p>Silas gives me another padlock.</p> <p>‚ÄúHmm,¬†this is harder than it looks,‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†I think I broke the pick,‚Äù Pat shows us a completely bent piece of metal.</p> <p>Instead of picking the lock I just got from Silas, I pick up a sturdy-looking box Silas put on the table.‚ÄÇIt looks somewhat like a safe.‚ÄÇBut it seems like it‚Äôs made of very thin metal.‚ÄÇIf it were thick metal, there wouldn‚Äôt be any space inside.</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs this?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lock-picking challenge that‚Äôs being distributed by a locksmith in the capital,‚Äù Silas answers, ‚Äúthe locksmith promises a prize to whoever can open these.‚ÄÇThe boxes are sturdy since they‚Äôre made from Mithril.‚ÄÇThe contents of the vials inside decompose if someone forcefully melts through the metal.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAre there any other restrictions?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†but this is still way too hard for you.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLet me try something I have an idea‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>I imagine the lock opening.‚ÄÇAll that needs to happen is the lock mechanism to turn.</p> <p><em>‚ÄúUnlock!‚Äù</em></p> <p>I can hear a click.‚ÄÇI open the door of the safe.‚ÄÇThere are two vials that touch the walls, connected by a stone contraption.‚ÄÇThe stone looks like a very brittle mineral.‚ÄÇThe contraption is exactly the size, so it doesn‚Äôt bump around in the safe when transporting it.‚ÄÇThe walls of the safe are a little thicker than I assumed, but still not even half as thick as I would expect from a safe.‚ÄÇI look at Silas. He shakes his head.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of magic that can pick locks, but I‚Äôve never seen it.‚ÄÇWhere did you learn that?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI just tried it out.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt know if it would work.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou should meet the locksmith and demonstrate the spell,‚Äù Silas whispers, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see his face when you show that to him.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù I whisper back.</p> <p>‚ÄúI think I should be saying something about this,‚Äù Matt interjects, ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs keep it at this: don‚Äôt introduce him to unsavoury folks.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, that person is very reputable.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI have to take your word for it‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" A Short Chapter Where (Almost) Nothing Happens" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/40-a-short-chapter-where-almost-nothing-happens/">A Short Chapter Where (Almost) Nothing Happens</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/42-hot-spring-after-a-trip-in-the-rain/">Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
