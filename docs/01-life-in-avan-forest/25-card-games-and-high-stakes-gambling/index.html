cards: ‚ÄúThere are four suits: swords, wands, coins, and hearts.‚Äù Swords, wands, coins and hearts?!‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs an interesting combination.‚ÄÇIn my previous life, the suits for playing cards were spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts.‚ÄÇThough tarot cards had different four suits: swords, wands, coins and cups.‚ÄÇI even used to divine with tarot cards.‚ÄÇI wonder if I can divine with these cards, as well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll try later. ‚ÄúSo each card exists in these suits?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†the colour has numbers: one to E (el) and an extra card called the core.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe core?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe core is a special card you see.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs both the higher than E (el) and lower than one.‚Äù I guess with just those cards I can‚Äôt divine, too bad.‚ÄÇSilas shows me some example cards.‚ÄÇThe first card has a drawing of a sword on it.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs the number one on the corners of the card.‚ÄÇThe second card is empty, there are no numbers in the corners.‚ÄÇAnd there an outline of a sword on the card.‚ÄÇSo cards are still at the very basic stage of card game evolution‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI see. So the cards with the outline and no numbers are the core of that set.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor the most common game, we use one single deck.‚ÄÇEach person gets five cards.‚ÄÇYou can choose how many cards you want to place with fresh ones.‚ÄÇThe goal is to get the highest pattern.‚Äù So it‚Äôs basically poker. ‚ÄúSo the patterns are‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶ from the lowest to highest: one Pair, two Pairs, a Triplet, Flow, Purity, Abundance, Pure Flow, Apex Flow.‚Äù ‚ÄúFlow?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs five cards with neighbouring numbers.‚ÄÇA Purity is five random cards of the same colour.‚ÄÇAn Abundance is a triplet and a pair.‚ÄÇA Purity Flow is both a Purity and a Flow at once.‚ÄÇAnd an Apex Flow is just a purity flow with the core as the highest card.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs just poker,‚Äù I mutter to myself‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve heard of it,‚Äù Silas asks.‚ÄÇOops, that could have gone terribly wrong. ‚ÄúYes,¬†but it‚Äôs been quite a while‚Ä¶ Anyway, let‚Äôs play,‚Äù he puts a small bag on the table, ‚Äúdo you have coins?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?! We gambling right away?!‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs no fun if we don‚Äôt.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have coins.‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt used money so such a long time.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt even know what it looks like anymore.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†right I forgot.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can make us some playing coins from glass.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease do, Swift,‚Äù Seth interjects, ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt gamble with money.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs unsightly.‚ÄÇBut I can‚Äôt deny gambling is a skill you might need in the future‚Ä¶‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs play some games!‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, ‚Äù, I take some sand from my Infinite Storage, ‚ÄúVitrify!‚Äù The coins end up in multiple different colours.‚ÄÇI should check out why later.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs a happy little accident ‚Äî I have different coloured ones!‚ÄÇI divide the coins into piles for everyone.‚ÄÇSilas deals the cards.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve just a pair of nines.‚ÄÇI keep the nines and exchange the other cards.‚ÄÇI get a nine and a pair of ones.‚ÄÇLucky me!‚ÄÇA Full House, I mean an Abundance.‚ÄÇOh yeah, I do have Lucky Devil trait. ‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe each show one card of our hand in turn.‚ÄÇIf you want to drop out, that‚Äôs fine.‚ÄÇBut if you want to keep playing, you need to bet some coin.‚ÄÇLet me start.‚Äù He shows a core and puts in a coin as well. ‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I show one of the ones, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not much, but I‚Äôm in,‚Äù I push one coin to the centre. ‚ÄúDaring, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù Silas answers.‚ÄÇHe doesn‚Äôt budge at all. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm folding,‚Äù Seth says.‚ÄÇHe places his cards face-down. ‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù Sain follows. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bluffing,‚Äù I grin. ‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù He reveals another core.‚ÄÇAnd pushes in one more coin.‚ÄÇUh oh, that‚Äôs a pair of cores.‚ÄÇMaybe‚Äôs he for real?‚ÄÇI reveal another one and push in a second coin too. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look good for you, Swift,‚Äù Seth says. Silas reveals an eight and puts in a third coin.‚ÄÇOK, he‚Äôs definitely bluffing.‚ÄÇI reveal an eight and put in a coin, too. ‚ÄúYou win. I fold,‚Äù Silas says. He turns over the revealed cards. ‚ÄúOh,¬†you‚Äôre playing cards?‚Äù Matt has just left the bathroom. ‚ÄúSwift made us some glass coins to play.‚ÄÇSo we can gamble without reservations.‚Äù ‚ÄúYoung Master, you can join in my place.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm going to take a bath,‚Äù with that Silas leaves the room. We continue playing.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm winning quite a lot. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite good at this,‚Äù Matt says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just lucky.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery lucky.‚ÄÇIs that the famous Neotes Luck?‚Äù ‚ÄúNeotes Luck?‚Äù ‚ÄúSome Neotes are very lucky.‚ÄÇThey are so lucky, we believe they have some secret blessing.‚ÄÇThough we‚Äôve never been able to detect that.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou mean just like Matt‚Äôs Super Intuition?‚Äù ‚ÄúSuper Intuition? I have that?‚ÄÇI read about it in our family history!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a trait that had been passed down in our family before.‚ÄÇBut apparently, it was lost generations ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe just the methods to detect it were lost,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Neotes Luck blessing you were talking about exists.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a hidden trait for Neotes called Lucky Devil.‚ÄÇAnd the Identifying Crystal you used before wasn‚Äôt able to pick up that trait.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo your Mystic Eye of Analysis can?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it can.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust be careful.‚ÄÇAnd don‚Äôt rely too much on your traits.‚ÄÇAnd don‚Äôt get addicted to gambling,‚Äù Seth sounds concerned. ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm not keen on gambling away my pants.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf only it was only your pants that are in danger, I wouldn‚Äôt this concerned.‚ÄÇSome people lost their freedom due to their debts.‚ÄÇDebts made worse due to gambling.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù So debt slavery is a thing here‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure to avoid that.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs change the topic: how about you sparring with Young Master tomorrow?‚ÄÇThat way I can see your skills as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù Silas is back from the bath.‚ÄÇHe glances at the piles, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre winning lots.‚ÄÇCare to play another game?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about we make it more interesting?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about the loser spends a day buck naked?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would I‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you are afraid of losing!‚Äù That‚Äôs it, ‚Äúfine! You‚Äôre on!‚Äù Silas shuffles the cards.‚ÄÇMy first draw isn‚Äôt looking great.‚ÄÇI sigh. I replace all the cards. ‚ÄúBad draw? Too bad.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I can still luck out,‚Äù I draw my new cards.‚ÄÇEight, nine, E (el) the core of swords and‚Ä¶ a one of hearts.‚ÄÇDamn, I need the X (deca) of swords. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling generous. How about another swap?‚Äù Wow,¬†he‚Äôs terribly confident! ‚ÄúHmm,¬†sure. I‚Äôll take you up on your offer,‚Äù I replace my last card.‚ÄÇJackpot! It‚Äôs the X (deca) of swords. ‚ÄúSince it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to raise the stakes so let‚Äôs just open for the showdown.‚ÄÇI have abundance, quite a high one.‚ÄÇI think you lose,‚Äù he opens this hand.‚ÄÇThree cores and a pair of twos. ‚ÄúToo bad‚Ä¶‚Äù I open my hand, ‚ÄúI have an Apex Flow.‚ÄÇI win,‚Äù I smile. ‚ÄúWhat?! But‚Ä¶ How?!‚Äù Silas stutters. ‚ÄúWell, you lose Silas. Unlike you, he didn‚Äôt even cheat,‚Äù Matt says. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt? Wait, how did you even‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI guess the famous Neotes luck was just stronger.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI should be careful about gambling?‚ÄÇI know,‚Äù I add. ‚ÄúThen why did you‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas is still stuttering. ‚ÄúEven if I were to lose the game, I don‚Äôt have much to lose there. I live by myself in the forest.‚Äù ‚ÄúA true gentleman honours debts, especially gambling debts,‚Äù Seth finally adds. ‚ÄúFine!

We gambling right away?!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs no fun if we don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have coins.‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt used money so such a long time.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt even know what it looks like anymore.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†right I forgot.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI can make us some playing coins from glass.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúPlease do, Swift,‚Äù Seth interjects, ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt gamble with money.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs unsightly.‚ÄÇBut I can‚Äôt deny gambling is a skill you might need in the future‚Ä¶‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs play some games!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAlright, ‚Äù, I take some sand from my Infinite Storage, <em>‚ÄúVitrify!‚Äù</em></p> <p>The coins end up in multiple different colours.‚ÄÇI should check out why later.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs a happy little accident ‚Äî I have different coloured ones!‚ÄÇI divide the coins into piles for everyone.‚ÄÇSilas deals the cards.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve just a pair of nines.‚ÄÇI keep the nines and exchange the other cards.‚ÄÇI get a nine and a pair of ones.‚ÄÇLucky me!‚ÄÇA Full House, I mean an Abundance.‚ÄÇOh yeah, I do have Lucky Devil trait.</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWe each show one card of our hand in turn.‚ÄÇIf you want to drop out, that‚Äôs fine.‚ÄÇBut if you want to keep playing, you need to bet some coin.‚ÄÇLet me start.‚Äù</p> <p>He shows a core and puts in a coin as well.</p> <p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I show one of the ones, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not much, but I‚Äôm in,‚Äù I push one coin to the centre.</p> <p>‚ÄúDaring, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù Silas answers.‚ÄÇHe doesn‚Äôt budge at all.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm folding,‚Äù Seth says.‚ÄÇHe places his cards face-down.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo am I,‚Äù Sain follows.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bluffing,‚Äù I grin.</p> <p>‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù He reveals another core.‚ÄÇAnd pushes in one more coin.‚ÄÇUh oh, that‚Äôs a pair of cores.‚ÄÇMaybe‚Äôs he for real?‚ÄÇI reveal another one and push in a second coin too.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look good for you, Swift,‚Äù Seth says.</p> <p>Silas reveals an eight and puts in a third coin.‚ÄÇOK, he‚Äôs definitely bluffing.‚ÄÇI reveal an eight and put in a coin, too.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou win. I fold,‚Äù Silas says. He turns over the revealed cards.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†you‚Äôre playing cards?‚Äù Matt has just left the bathroom.</p> <p>‚ÄúSwift made us some glass coins to play.‚ÄÇSo we can gamble without reservations.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYoung Master, you can join in my place.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm going to take a bath,‚Äù with that Silas leaves the room.</p> <p>We continue playing.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm winning quite a lot.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite good at this,‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm just lucky.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúVery lucky.‚ÄÇIs that the famous Neotes Luck?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNeotes Luck?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSome Neotes are very lucky.‚ÄÇThey are so lucky, we believe they have some secret blessing.‚ÄÇThough we‚Äôve never been able to detect that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou mean just like Matt‚Äôs Super Intuition?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSuper Intuition? I have that?‚ÄÇI read about it in our family history!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a trait that had been passed down in our family before.‚ÄÇBut apparently, it was lost generations ago.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúMaybe just the methods to detect it were lost,‚Äù I answer.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThe Neotes Luck blessing you were talking about exists.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a hidden trait for Neotes called Lucky Devil.‚ÄÇAnd the Identifying Crystal you used before wasn‚Äôt able to pick up that trait.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo your Mystic Eye of Analysis can?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it can.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúJust be careful.‚ÄÇAnd don‚Äôt rely too much on your traits.‚ÄÇAnd don‚Äôt get addicted to gambling,‚Äù Seth sounds concerned.</p> <p>‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm not keen on gambling away my pants.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf only it was only your pants that are in danger, I wouldn‚Äôt this concerned.‚ÄÇSome people lost their freedom due to their debts.‚ÄÇDebts made worse due to gambling.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù So debt slavery is a thing here‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure to avoid that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs change the topic: how about you sparring with Young Master tomorrow?‚ÄÇThat way I can see your skills as well.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù Silas is back from the bath.‚ÄÇHe glances at the piles, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre winning lots.‚ÄÇCare to play another game?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHow about we make it more interesting?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHow about the loser spends a day buck naked?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy would I‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat are you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo you are afraid of losing!‚Äù</p> <p>That‚Äôs it, ‚Äúfine! You‚Äôre on!‚Äù</p> <p>Silas shuffles the cards.‚ÄÇMy first draw isn‚Äôt looking great.‚ÄÇI sigh. I replace all the cards.</p> <p>‚ÄúBad draw? Too bad.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, I can still luck out,‚Äù I draw my new cards.‚ÄÇEight, nine, <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label="el"><rb>E</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>el</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> the core of swords and‚Ä¶ a one of hearts.‚ÄÇDamn, I need the <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label="deca"><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>deca</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> of swords.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling generous. How about another swap?‚Äù</p> <p>Wow,¬†he‚Äôs terribly confident!</p> <p>‚ÄúHmm,¬†sure. I‚Äôll take you up on your offer,‚Äù I replace my last card.‚ÄÇJackpot! It‚Äôs the <ruby class="text-nowrap" aria-label="deca"><rb>X</rb><rp> (</rp><rt>deca</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> of swords.</p> <p>‚ÄúSince it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to raise the stakes so let‚Äôs just open for the showdown.‚ÄÇI have abundance, quite a high one.‚ÄÇI think you lose,‚Äù he opens this hand.‚ÄÇThree cores and a pair of twos.</p> <p>‚ÄúToo bad‚Ä¶‚Äù I open my hand, ‚ÄúI have an Apex Flow.‚ÄÇI win,‚Äù I smile.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat?! But‚Ä¶ How?!‚Äù Silas stutters.</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, you lose Silas. Unlike you, he didn‚Äôt even cheat,‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt? Wait, how did you even‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI guess the famous Neotes luck was just stronger.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI should be careful about gambling?‚ÄÇI know,‚Äù I add.</p> <p>‚ÄúThen why did you‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas is still stuttering.</p> <p>‚ÄúEven if I were to lose the game, I don‚Äôt have much to lose there. I live by myself in the forest.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúA true gentleman honours debts, especially gambling debts,‚Äù Seth finally adds.</p> <p>‚ÄúFine! I‚Äôll spend tomorrow buck naked,‚Äù Silas finally gives up.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" First Day of Real Training" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/24-first-day-of-real-training/">First Day of Real Training</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Swift Mittens, the Kitten" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/26-swift-mittens-the-kitten/">Swift Mittens, the Kitten</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-mt-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
