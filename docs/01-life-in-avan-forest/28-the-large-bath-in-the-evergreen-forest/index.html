life.‚ÄÇThe plan is to plant two rows of various forest trees at two neighbouring edges of the space.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not using Forest Magic to speed up growth ‚Äî that would deplete the nutrients in the soil too fast, so they‚Äôre all saplings for now. Sain told me there‚Äôs such thing as rain in a Magic Space, so I need some other solution.‚ÄÇI can water them regularly, but it would be better if I can this place to be self-sufficient.‚ÄÇWhile I still have some Continuous Magic Crystal of Magic Water left, I don‚Äôt enough to create a steady stream; I leave the idea of a trench of water for later and just spread the crystals out instead.‚ÄÇIf I place a crystal each between a pair of trees, I still don‚Äôt have just enough‚Ä¶ I need to gather more. ‚ÄúI need to go and try to gather some crystals for this,‚Äù I tell Sain and Silas. ‚ÄúFrom the Crystal Down?‚Äù Sain asks. ‚ÄúYes,¬†from the Crystal Down,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stay here then, it‚Äôs not like we can help you with that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I leave for the Crystal Down. At the Down, I scan for Continuous Magic Crystals.‚ÄÇI walk aimlessly across the down.‚ÄÇI find some Continuous Magic Crystals of Cold.‚ÄÇNice, I can make a fridge with this!‚ÄÇBut this isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶ Eventually, I find a little stream that I follow to its source.‚ÄÇLucky me! Continuous Magic Crystals of Magic Water!‚ÄÇMore than enough to create a stream.‚ÄÇI pocket them into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇI still have time, so I continue walking aimlessly for a while. Oh,¬†that‚Äôs a nice cozy heat!‚ÄÇI find more Continuous Magic Crystals of Heat.‚ÄÇI could make a big bath in my Magic Space!‚ÄÇI can cool down the excess water and use it to water the tree.‚ÄÇI store those crystals as well.‚ÄÇI return to the cave.‚ÄÇI meet Matt and Seth who are still sparring. ‚ÄúOh,¬†you‚Äôre back. Did you get the crystals you need?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúYes,¬†I did,‚Äù I go back into the Magic Space. Sain and Silas have already dug some trenches. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt away that long?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is just some basic gardening.‚ÄÇDid you get what you needed?‚Äù Sain says. ‚ÄúYes,¬†I did. Though I changed my mind about some details.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat details?‚Äù ‚ÄúI want to put in a bath here.‚ÄÇI figured if I put a large one here, I can use whenever I like.‚Äù ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that overdoing it?‚ÄÇMost people that can make Magic Spaces just have a basic camp in there‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy just a basic camp?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚ÄÇThere are not many people that can use Space Magic.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. Anyway, those trenches you made are coming in handy.‚Äù I take some sand from my Infinite Storage to create a Big Pool about height with steps to sit in it.‚ÄÇOne big enough for all of us.‚ÄÇThere should be three pillars in the centre where I can place the crystals.‚ÄÇOf course, I need an overflow spout in the direction of the trench as well. ‚ÄúCompaction!‚Äù The Pool forms, along with the pillars.‚ÄÇI take out more sand to make a coating of glass. ‚ÄúVitrify!‚Äù The red glowing glass slowly spread across the whole construction.‚ÄÇI set the crystals in the same arrangement as I have in my bathroom.‚ÄÇHot water starts filling the pool.‚ÄÇOn the outside of the pool, just below exhaust spout, I place some Continuous Magic Crystals of Magic Water.‚ÄÇI wait for the water to overflow the tube and check the temperature of the mixed water. ‚ÄúAs expected, it‚Äôs a tad too warm to water plants.‚Äù I place some Continuous Magic Crystals of Cold in the path to the trench.‚ÄÇI check the temperature again. ‚ÄúThis feels about right, what do you think?‚Äù Sain checks the temperature. ‚ÄúMaybe a little colder‚Ä¶‚Äù I add another Continuous Magic Crystal of Magic Water. ‚ÄúThat feels about right‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Sain? You seem deep in thought.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanted to teach you something as well. But I wonder if there‚Äôs anything I can teach you at all‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? I‚Äôm just improvising here!‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. So you don‚Äôt know any spells?‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly those that I have discovered.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll prepare something for the next visit.‚ÄÇThanks a lot!‚Äù Sain‚Äôs mood improves. ‚ÄúNo,¬†I have to thank you.‚ÄÇSince the big bath is ready how about we enjoy this later?‚Äù ‚ÄúSounds great.‚Äù Sain volunteers to make food today, so leave some meat and groceries with him.‚ÄÇAfter lunch, I go the check the trenches.‚ÄÇThe water level is not too high, and it even reaches the opposite end.‚ÄÇGreat! I leave the Magic Space and I spend the rest of the day sparring with Silas. Like yesterday, he pushes me relentlessly.‚ÄÇBut I can keep up. Barely.‚ÄÇEventually, I feel confident enough to counterattack.‚ÄÇOf course, he just guards against it like it‚Äôs nothing.‚ÄÇDamn‚Ä¶ I continue trying‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHuff, In the end, I still can‚Äôt land a single hit on you.‚ÄÇPant, maybe I should try again as a cat!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat punch this morning‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt prepared for it, but still, it was quite something.‚ÄÇI can still feel it.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can still feel it? Are you okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs just the memory.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll need to start watching my back against cats now.‚Äù We both laugh. After dinner, we all go to the new bath. ‚ÄúThis feels great,‚Äù Matt exclaims. ‚ÄúI agree, purr‚Äù, I answer. I just can‚Äôt stop myself from purring.‚ÄÇAt this point, I just don‚Äôt care about the purring anymore.‚ÄÇThe bath feels so great! It‚Äôs as if energy is flowing back into me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have all of us in a bath when we‚Äôre not in the castle for a while,‚Äù Seth says. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the issue when you‚Äôre around me.‚ÄÇNot all of us can be unarmed at the same time.‚ÄÇSo usually one of them keeps watch when the rest is bathing,‚Äù Matt explains. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn your case, a Magic Space is a very safe space.‚ÄÇSince it‚Äôs impossible for people don‚Äôt trust to enter,‚Äù Sain adds. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt? That‚Äôs great. So that would make travelling much easier.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are planning on travelling?‚Äù Matt asks, ‚ÄúWhen will you go?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†right. Today, I heard you will be becoming an adventurer for a while when you come of age.‚ÄÇI think I‚Äôd be joining you when that happens.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll have me, of course.‚Äù ‚ÄúGladly. I‚Äôll be in your care.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll introduce you to the others in the group next time.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm not drawing all too much trouble.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll be in your care.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince that‚Äôs settled, we just need to keep training the two of you,‚Äù Seth says. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt overdo it‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 28: The Large Bath in the Evergreen Forest"> The Large Bath in the Evergreen Forest </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-01-31, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/NotKeoni#1327" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">notKeoni</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Creating the Evergreen Forest" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/27-creating-the-evergreen-forest/">Creating the Evergreen Forest</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="My First Trip to the Capital!" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/29-my-first-trip-to-the-capital/">My First Trip to the Capital!</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>With the help of Silas and Sain, the Magic Space starts to fill with life.‚ÄÇThe plan is to plant two rows of various forest trees at two neighbouring edges of the space.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not using Forest Magic to speed up growth ‚Äî that would deplete the nutrients in the soil too fast, so they‚Äôre all saplings for now.</p> <p>Sain told me there‚Äôs such thing as rain in a Magic Space, so I need some other solution.‚ÄÇI can water them regularly, but it would be better if I can this place to be self-sufficient.‚ÄÇWhile I still have some Continuous Magic Crystal of Magic Water left, I don‚Äôt enough to create a steady stream; I leave the idea of a trench of water for later and just spread the crystals out instead.‚ÄÇIf I place a crystal each between a pair of trees, I still don‚Äôt have just enough‚Ä¶ I need to gather more.</p> <p>‚ÄúI need to go and try to gather some crystals for this,‚Äù I tell Sain and Silas.</p> <p>‚ÄúFrom the Crystal Down?‚Äù Sain asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†from the Crystal Down,‚Äù I answer.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stay here then, it‚Äôs not like we can help you with that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I leave for the Crystal Down.</p> <p>At the Down, I scan for Continuous Magic Crystals.‚ÄÇI walk aimlessly across the down.‚ÄÇI find some Continuous Magic Crystals of Cold.‚ÄÇNice, I can make a fridge with this!‚ÄÇBut this isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶</p> <p>Eventually, I find a little stream that I follow to its source.‚ÄÇLucky me!

Barely.‚ÄÇEventually, I feel confident enough to counterattack.‚ÄÇOf course, he just guards against it like it‚Äôs nothing.‚ÄÇDamn‚Ä¶ I continue trying‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúHuff, In the end, I still can‚Äôt land a single hit on you.‚ÄÇPant, maybe I should try again as a cat!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat punch this morning‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt prepared for it, but still, it was quite something.‚ÄÇI can still feel it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou can still feel it? Are you okay?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs just the memory.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll need to start watching my back against cats now.‚Äù</p> <p>We both laugh.</p> <p>After dinner, we all go to the new bath.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis feels great,‚Äù Matt exclaims.</p> <p>‚ÄúI agree, <em>purr</em>‚Äù, I answer.</p> <p>I just can‚Äôt stop myself from purring.‚ÄÇAt this point, I just don‚Äôt care about the purring anymore.‚ÄÇThe bath feels so great! It‚Äôs as if energy is flowing back into me.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have all of us in a bath when we‚Äôre not in the castle for a while,‚Äù Seth says.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the issue when you‚Äôre around me.‚ÄÇNot all of us can be unarmed at the same time.‚ÄÇSo usually one of them keeps watch when the rest is bathing,‚Äù Matt explains.</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIn your case, a Magic Space is a very safe space.‚ÄÇSince it‚Äôs impossible for people don‚Äôt trust to enter,‚Äù Sain adds.</p> <p>‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt? That‚Äôs great. So that would make travelling much easier.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou are planning on travelling?‚Äù Matt asks, ‚ÄúWhen will you go?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†right. Today, I heard you will be becoming an adventurer for a while when you come of age.‚ÄÇI think I‚Äôd be joining you when that happens.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou will?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll have me, of course.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúGladly. I‚Äôll be in your care.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll introduce you to the others in the group next time.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm not drawing all too much trouble.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll be in your care.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSince that‚Äôs settled, we just need to keep training the two of you,‚Äù Seth says.</p> <p>‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt overdo it‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Creating the Evergreen Forest" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/27-creating-the-evergreen-forest/">Creating the Evergreen Forest</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="My First Trip to the Capital!" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/29-my-first-trip-to-the-capital/">My First Trip to the Capital!</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
