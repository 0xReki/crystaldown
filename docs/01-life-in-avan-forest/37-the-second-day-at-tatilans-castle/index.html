I want to show him immediately, but Matt signals me not to do so.‚ÄÇSo it‚Äôs going to be a surprise for next week then.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 37: The Second Day At Tatilans Castle"> The Second Day At Tatilans Castle </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-02-21, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/NotKeoni#1327" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">notKeoni</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Reading and an Unexpected Find" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/36-reading-and-an-unexpected-find/">Reading and an Unexpected Find</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Tales of Maple Wine" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/38-tales-of-maple-wine/">Tales of Maple Wine</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>After lunch, we‚Äôre back to Matt‚Äôs office.

after the farm is built.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll share some of my Slimes at that time.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep in contact.‚ÄÇTill next time.‚Äù</p> <p>Alexander leaves.</p> <p>Patrick sits next to me.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe days have been quite busy‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI could go for a dip in a nice hot bath,‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúIs there one here?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it should be free now,‚Äù Matt answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hit the bath, too,‚Äù Kat says.</p> <p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go then.‚Äù</p> <p>As expected, it‚Äôs gender-separated baths.</p> <p>‚ÄúMaybe I should get some separators installed in my bath‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumble while getting undressed.</p> <p>‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt just build a second one next to it?‚Äù Matt asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúI could do that, too,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what I can do.‚Äù</p> <p>We enter the bath.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe bath feels so nice, <em>purr</em>.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI agree, <em>purr</em>,‚Äù Patrick answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúCome to think of it, I‚Äôve never heard Pat purr,‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúMost high-born Ailuranthropes think it‚Äôs above them to purr,‚Äù he answers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to show more of my feline side when we‚Äôre amongst our group.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs kinda sad how many high born Ailuranthropes are so ashamed of their feline side.‚ÄÇAs if they‚Äôre ashamed of being born an Ailuranthrope.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd the reason you only do that when we‚Äôre amongst ourselves is?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt would be bad for Matt‚Äôs image if I did that publicly now.‚ÄÇYou don‚Äôt need to change since you‚Äôre the keeper.‚ÄÇMaybe people will start changing the way they think.‚ÄÇAfter all, you‚Äôve been chosen by the gods to become the keeper.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIs that what people think?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†that‚Äôs what they think,‚Äù Matt answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI still think this bath can‚Äôt compare to yours‚Äù, Matt changes the topic, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put my finger on what‚Äôs different.‚ÄÇBut your bath is much more relaxing and energizing‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat sure sounds great.‚ÄÇI really want to see it,‚Äù Patrick says.</p> <p>I want to show him immediately, but Matt signals me not to do so.‚ÄÇSo it‚Äôs going to be a surprise for next week then.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Reading and an Unexpected Find"
