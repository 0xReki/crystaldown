It feels as if this takes hours‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut I finally have the cipher, again.‚ÄÇNow I can just translate the book into my notes.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs mindless typing, so I‚Äôll put it off for now. I go to the kitchen and start cooking.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt get any seaweed or any replacement, so I‚Äôm making Sashimi for now.‚ÄÇI take several of the Sky Salmons and use magic to freeze them.‚ÄÇIf I can cool them down to cold enough, it should kill any possible parasites. ‚ÄúAbsolute Zero!‚Äù The fish is immediately frozen solid.‚ÄÇCloudy smoke flows from the fish to the ground.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no blueish liquid, so there‚Äôs no need to worry about oxygen explosions.‚ÄÇI leave the fish to slowly thaw.‚ÄÇWhile waiting I‚Äôm making rice.‚ÄÇIt feels like forever since I made rice without I rice cooker.‚ÄÇRice cookers were so convenient!‚ÄÇWhile the pot with rice and water is heating up, I cut up some Barrots and put them into vinegar.‚ÄÇThe water is boiling so, I turn down the heat by moving the pot further away from the fire. After a bell, I start cutting the Sky Salmon and put some rice into a bowl.‚ÄÇI cut some Barrots too.‚ÄÇI put the Barrot green on a plate and let the Bunnyflies eat.‚ÄÇAnd I finally start eating myself.‚ÄÇThe Sashimi tastes as I expected.‚ÄÇSoy sauce would be really nice! After eating, I store everything I have over in my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇAnd start transcribing the book letter for letter with the cipher I have.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs quite a lot of text.‚ÄÇI need to spread this over multiple days.‚ÄÇAfter I‚Äôm done for the day, I go to the bath in the Evergreen Forest.‚ÄÇPurr, a hot bath after sitting around for hours feels nice.‚ÄÇI continue transcribing the next days.‚ÄÇAfter a few days, I‚Äôm finally done.‚ÄÇI read the notes. The book ‚Äî ‚ÄúHow to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with Cratherion Ingredients‚Äù ‚Äî is very detailed.‚ÄÇAfter stating the name of the replacement ingredient, it describes where said ingredient can be found and how it needs to be processed to get the desired taste or effect. I look up seaweed.‚ÄÇNice, I can use Futo Leaves for that.‚ÄÇThey even grow in the Southern part of Avan Forest!‚ÄÇI can go there after Matt‚Äôs group is gone.‚ÄÇI still need to make an additional room for Katherine and Luna. I create another room in no time at all.‚ÄÇNext is creating a separate second bath in the Evergreen Forest.‚ÄÇSince I‚Äôm already here, I lead my Slimes into the Magic Space to have them create Fertilizer.‚ÄÇThose Slimes have evolved into Fertilizer Slimes.‚ÄÇUsing Earth Magic, I mix the fertilizer into the soil and I again speed up the growth of the trees by another month or two using Forest Magic. I check the health of the trees, and they seem to do fine.‚ÄÇThe Tarry and Wooberry cultivation experiment is going well. After that, I create a second bath and a wall separating the two.‚ÄÇThe bath is about half the size of the other bath.‚ÄÇSince the wall is just a visual cover, it‚Äôs relatively thin.‚ÄÇI also add some walls to the front so you can‚Äôt be seen while undressing if someone were to be coming in from the entrance.‚ÄÇSome shelves for putting in your clothes would be nice too.‚ÄÇSo I add those, too. Since I‚Äôm finally done, I take a bath like I do every day.‚ÄÇPurr‚Ä¶ So Matt‚Äôs group should be coming the day after tomorrow‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI think I can go gathering Futo Leaves tomorrow.‚ÄÇI hope they are big enough so I can use them as I‚Äôm used to with Nori. The next day, I go to the southern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇI try finding trees I‚Äôm unfamiliar with.‚ÄÇI analyze them, but I can‚Äôt seem to find any Futo.‚ÄÇHave they gone extinct? My Bunnyflies are with me.‚ÄÇFor some reason, they just keep gathering around certain ferns. ¬´What‚Äôs up, Faryl, Felix?¬ª, I ask. ¬´We found tasty plants!¬ª they answer. I pick a leaf and taste it. Yuck! It‚Äôs bitter! ¬´Are you sure?¬ª, I ask, ¬´It‚Äôs bitter‚Ä¶¬ª* Glossary: Feno It‚Äôs harmless to eat.‚ÄÇDespite the plant tasting bitter, Bunnyflies still like eating it.‚ÄÇIn fact, they even love it. It‚Äôs bitter, but yet it feels so nostalgic.‚ÄÇI wonder why‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut since the Butterflies seem to like it; I gather some and put it into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇThen it hit me: what if Futo aren‚Äôt trees?‚ÄÇThey could be ferns or shrubs! I scan my surroundings again.‚ÄÇFinally, I find what I‚Äôve been looking for: red ferns. Glossary: Futo Futo leaves are edible.‚ÄÇThey grow everywhere, provided the needed humidity.‚ÄÇThey are rarely used in cooking.‚ÄÇBut they are said to be healthy, especially for Ailuranthropes. Healthy for especially for Ailuranthropes?‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs a welcome surprise!‚ÄÇI collect some Futo leaves.‚ÄÇAfter gathering enough to make multiple servings of Sushi, I make my way back to my cave. I‚Äôll postpone the Sushi cooking until tomorrow when Matt and the others come.‚ÄÇI think some of them might be averse to eating raw fish, so I take a detour and hunt a boar. After bringing it back to my cave, I start preparing it so I can cook it tomorrow.‚ÄÇAfter waiting for my Blood Slimes draining the blood, I start dismantling it.‚ÄÇDismantling is so much easier with the knife Glorindamli made for me! I put all the things I harvested into my Infinite Storage and give the rest to the Slimes to eat.‚ÄÇMost of the evolved Slimes aren‚Äôt interested in the entrails, only the unevolved ones and the Fertilizer Slimes are.‚ÄÇNone of the Slimes seem hungry, so I don‚Äôt need to find extra food for them. It‚Äôs been a busy day, I take a nice hot bath in the Evergreen Forest and get to bed.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 39: Making Sashimi and Gathering Fern"> Making Sashimi and Gathering
