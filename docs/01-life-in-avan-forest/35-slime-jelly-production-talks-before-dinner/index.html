similar to the layout of my cave.‚ÄÇThe only difference is his main area being an office.‚ÄÇMatt and Kat are already there.‚ÄÇThese also an older Hume in the room. ‚ÄúHey,¬†how was your time with Lady Aenwyn?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúGreat, I learned a lot, thanks.‚ÄÇHow are things on your end?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done for today.‚ÄÇBut I have some unpleasant business to attend to tomorrow.‚ÄÇSo I can‚Äôt spend the day with you.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault she was being unreasonable.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know, but even so‚Ä¶‚ÄÇWait‚Ä¶ how do you even about this?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI told him about it,‚Äù Patrick calmly says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told Patrick.‚ÄÇMe being present there would just be me expressing my schadenfreude, so I‚Äôll refrain from spectating.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇYou do know my father would possibly consider pardoning her if you were to ask him.‚Äù ‚ÄúMe? Why me?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are the keeper of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇWhile you don‚Äôt have the power, you do have quite the influence.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind.‚ÄÇI hear the schedule is quicker than usual.‚ÄÇIs there a special reason for that?‚Äù ‚ÄúShe was constantly nagging and screaming profanities at the guards and other prison inmates.‚ÄÇThey asked to move forward the schedule before something happens.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have to say I don‚Äôt feel bad for her.‚ÄÇHowever, I do feel bad for her husband.‚ÄÇHow is he coping with the situation?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have given up on saving my wife,‚Äù the man answers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve realized anything is futile as long as she isn‚Äôt willing to compromise.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that,‚Äù I really am.‚ÄÇYou probably deserve better, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be mean, but if she were to compromise‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI thank you for your kind offer, but knowing my wife, it‚Äôs not going to happen.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôll keep it in mind for the off case a miracle happens.‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Luket‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúPrince Matthew, please call me Alexander, I don‚Äôt have my title anymore.‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly if you stop calling me ‚ÄòPrince‚Äô!‚Äù ‚ÄúSigh‚Ä¶ Yes,¬†as you ask, Pr‚Ä¶, Matthew.‚ÄÇPeople will probably not ask me to act as their defence in trials anymore.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll probably take up cooking again,‚Äù Alexander says. ‚ÄúYou can cook?‚Äù Matt asks, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you could do that!‚Äù ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt cooked much since I married into House Luket.‚ÄÇI have to brag, I used to make quite tasty treats,‚Äù Alexander explains. ‚ÄúSwift also makes great food.‚ÄÇThat fruit jelly he made was really good.‚Äù ‚ÄúFruit jelly?‚Äù Alexander asks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just cooking fruit juice.‚ÄÇLet it cool down a little and then mix it with Slime Jelly,‚Äù I explain. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs simple.‚ÄÇI can only imagine how it the product would turn out‚Ä¶‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost dinnertime, so I‚Äôll just get a little sample from my Infinite Storage for you to taste,‚Äù I give him a small cube fruit jelly. ‚ÄúThis is great!!‚Äù he exclaims, ‚Äúis it alright to tell me the recipe?!‚ÄÇYou could earn a lot of money!!‚Äù Let‚Äôs begin the talks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs so much more I want to make.‚ÄÇBut back to the jelly: I hear people just don‚Äôt use Slime Jelly; it‚Äôs being ignored by people.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ and hiring adventures just to bring Slime Jelly isn‚Äôt that viable.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about cultivating Slimes?‚ÄÇAs far as I know, Slimes produce Slime Jelly when you feed them Fat,‚Äù I suggest. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea!‚Äù Alexander is excited.‚ÄÇHis excitement soon turns to despair though, ‚Äújust too bad, I don‚Äôt have to funds to start something like this anymore.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow about I give you the funding to start the project?‚Äù Matt suggests. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt possibly ask this of you!‚Äù Alexander resists. ‚ÄúI have a personal interest in the project, too.‚ÄÇAnd I know you are a person who can make it work.‚ÄÇAnything else is irrelevant.‚ÄÇEven though I was planning on arranging some money for you from the start.‚ÄÇThis works better since I have another real motive.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ thank you very much. I‚Äôll make it succeed,‚Äù Alexander is back to full vigour.‚ÄÇHe switches gears quite fast, especially for an old man like him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be great if you the recipe would spread‚Ä¶‚Äù I say.‚ÄÇThen it wouldn‚Äôt be a strange food anymore. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it happen.‚Äù ‚ÄúAbout the method to get Slime Jelly, I don‚Äôt mind if you keep it to yourself a little longer to make the production profitable,‚Äù I add, ‚Äúalso one hint about handling Slime Jelly: just melt it, but don‚Äôt boil it.‚ÄÇIt won‚Äôt turn back to jelly if you do.‚Äù While we were discussing, the maids have brought in the food.‚ÄÇAfter eating dinner, we move to the lounge and continue talking.‚ÄÇPatrick sits next to me. He sways as if he‚Äôs about to fall over. ‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a little tired.‚ÄÇHelping with Lady Aenwyn‚Äôs research was a bit draining,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI can‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat begins but she stops are Patrick shakes his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about Ailuranthropes,‚Äù I answer in his stead. ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat answers, ‚Äúdo your best.‚Äù Patrick leans on my shoulder.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm somewhat surprised, but I don‚Äôt dislike it. So I let him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs late.‚ÄÇSo I‚Äôll return tomorrow so we can write up an agreement on the Jelly,‚Äù Alexander says. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do that,‚Äù Matt answers. ‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù I carefully wave as Patrick has fallen asleep on my shoulder. Alexander leaves. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rare! Pat is usually quite averse against body contact,‚Äù Katherine says. ‚ÄúHard to imagine,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúI meant to ask what you guys specialize in.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve gotten training from Silas as Tracker ‚Äî my guild card says ‚ÄòIntelligence Specialist‚Äô.‚ÄÇI also have some magic skills.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a paladin,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚ÄúPatrick is our healer.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a swordswoman,‚Äù Luna says. She still sounds very unemotional. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an attack magic-user,‚Äù Kat says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best.‚Äù I carefully move Patrick off my shoulder. Matt puts a blanket on him. ‚ÄúI wonder what you guys did‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never seen him so worn out,‚Äù Matt says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to tell you, but Patrick told me it‚Äôs improper for Ailuranthropes to talk about certain things,‚Äù I answer.

Why me?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou are the keeper of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇWhile you don‚Äôt have the power, you do have quite the influence.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind.‚ÄÇI hear the schedule is quicker than usual.‚ÄÇIs there a special reason for that?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúShe was constantly nagging and screaming profanities at the guards and other prison inmates.‚ÄÇThey asked to move forward the schedule before something happens.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI have to say I don‚Äôt feel bad for her.‚ÄÇHowever, I do feel bad for her husband.‚ÄÇHow is he coping with the situation?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI have given up on saving my wife,‚Äù the man answers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve realized anything is futile as long as she isn‚Äôt willing to compromise.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that,‚Äù I really am.‚ÄÇYou probably deserve better, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be mean, but if she were to compromise‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI thank you for your kind offer, but knowing my wife, it‚Äôs not going to happen.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôll keep it in mind for the off case a miracle happens.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLord Luket‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúPrince Matthew, please call me Alexander, I don‚Äôt have my title anymore.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOnly if you stop calling me ‚ÄòPrince‚Äô!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSigh‚Ä¶ Yes,¬†as you ask, Pr‚Ä¶, Matthew.‚ÄÇPeople will probably not ask me to act as their defence in trials anymore.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll probably take up cooking again,‚Äù Alexander says.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou can cook?‚Äù Matt asks, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you could do that!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt cooked much since I married into House Luket.‚ÄÇI have to brag, I used to make quite tasty treats,‚Äù Alexander explains.</p> <p>‚ÄúSwift also makes great food.‚ÄÇThat fruit jelly he made was really good.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúFruit jelly?‚Äù Alexander asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just cooking fruit juice.‚ÄÇLet it cool down a little and then mix it with Slime Jelly,‚Äù I explain.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs simple.‚ÄÇI can only imagine how it the product would turn out‚Ä¶‚Äù he says.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost dinnertime, so I‚Äôll just get a little sample from my Infinite Storage for you to taste,‚Äù I give him a small cube fruit jelly.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis is great!!‚Äù he exclaims, ‚Äúis it alright to tell me the recipe?!‚ÄÇYou could earn a lot of money!!‚Äù</p> <p>Let‚Äôs begin the talks.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs so much more I want to make.‚ÄÇBut back to the jelly: I hear people just don‚Äôt use Slime Jelly; it‚Äôs being ignored by people.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ and hiring adventures just to bring Slime Jelly isn‚Äôt that viable.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHow about cultivating Slimes?‚ÄÇAs far as I know, Slimes produce Slime Jelly when you feed them Fat,‚Äù I suggest.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea!‚Äù Alexander is excited.‚ÄÇHis excitement soon turns to despair though, ‚Äújust too bad, I don‚Äôt have to funds to start something like this anymore.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHow about I give you the funding to start the project?‚Äù Matt suggests.</p> <p>‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt possibly ask this of you!‚Äù Alexander resists.</p> <p>‚ÄúI have a personal interest in the project, too.‚ÄÇAnd I know you are a person who can make it work.‚ÄÇAnything else is irrelevant.‚ÄÇEven though I was planning on arranging some money for you from the start.‚ÄÇThis works better since I have another real motive.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ thank you very much. I‚Äôll make it succeed,‚Äù Alexander is back to full vigour.‚ÄÇHe switches gears quite fast, especially for an old man like him.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd be great if you the recipe would spread‚Ä¶‚Äù I say.‚ÄÇThen it wouldn‚Äôt be a strange food anymore.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it happen.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAbout the method to get Slime Jelly, I don‚Äôt mind if you keep it to yourself a little longer to make the production profitable,‚Äù I add, ‚Äúalso one hint about handling Slime Jelly: just melt it, but don‚Äôt boil it.‚ÄÇIt won‚Äôt turn back to jelly if you do.‚Äù</p> <p>While we were discussing, the maids have brought in the food.‚ÄÇAfter eating dinner, we move to the lounge and continue talking.‚ÄÇPatrick sits next to me. He sways as if he‚Äôs about to fall over.</p> <p>‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a little tired.‚ÄÇHelping with Lady Aenwyn‚Äôs research was a bit draining,‚Äù he says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI can‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat begins but she stops are Patrick shakes his head.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about Ailuranthropes,‚Äù I answer in his stead.</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù Kat answers, ‚Äúdo your best.‚Äù</p> <p>Patrick leans on my shoulder.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm somewhat surprised, but I don‚Äôt dislike it. So I let him.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs late.‚ÄÇSo I‚Äôll return tomorrow so we can write up an agreement on the Jelly,‚Äù Alexander says.</p> <p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do that,‚Äù Matt answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù I carefully wave as Patrick has fallen asleep on my shoulder. Alexander leaves.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rare! Pat is usually quite averse against body contact,‚Äù Katherine says.</p> <p>‚ÄúHard to imagine,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúI meant to ask what you guys specialize in.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve gotten training from Silas as Tracker ‚Äî my guild card says ‚ÄòIntelligence Specialist‚Äô.‚ÄÇI also have some magic skills.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a paladin,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚ÄúPatrick is our healer.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a swordswoman,‚Äù Luna says. She still sounds very unemotional.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm an attack magic-user,‚Äù Kat says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best.‚Äù</p> <p>I carefully move Patrick off my shoulder. Matt puts a blanket on him.</p> <p>‚ÄúI wonder what you guys did‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never seen him so worn out,‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to tell you, but Patrick told me it‚Äôs improper for Ailuranthropes to talk about certain things,‚Äù I answer.</p> <p>Matt shows me to a guest room before he leaves for his own room.</p> <p><em>‚ÄúGate: Evergreen Forest!‚Äù</em></p> <p>I enter my Magic Space and take out my set of kitchen knives and some Sky Salmon from my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇI descale the Salmon and put both the descaled Sky Salmon and the scales back into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇI continue until I finish descaling all the Sky Salmon.‚ÄÇI hope this is enough to cover for Patrick‚Äôs and my Magic Yarn needs‚Ä¶</p> <p>I return to my room and go to sleep‚Ä¶‚ÄÇThis bed feels way too comfortable. <em>Purr</em>‚Ä¶‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Spinning Magic Yarn" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/34-spinning-magic-yarn/">Spinning Magic Yarn</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Reading and an Unexpected Find" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/36-reading-and-an-unexpected-find/">Reading and an Unexpected Find</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
