‚ÄúHow about practising with Silas then?‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs only so much you can do alone,‚Äù Seth suggests. ‚ÄúCan I?‚Äù Getting some proper training could help a lot. ‚ÄúSure, at least someone is eager to train!‚Äù Seth approves. ‚ÄúAll right, all right, I‚Äôll train as well,‚Äù Matt reluctantly answers. After a short rest, we leave the cave to start training.‚ÄÇSilas teaches me a lot: grips, maintenance, attack techniques, defence techniques‚Ä¶‚ÄÇThen we start sparring.‚ÄÇAt first, I can barely keep up with defending against his attacks.‚ÄÇBut eventually, I get the hang of it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a quick learner,‚Äù Silas says.‚ÄÇWe‚Äôve been training for a bell or so. ‚ÄúThanks, huff, I feel like I‚Äôve made a lot of progress‚Ä¶‚Äù I‚Äôm spent.

On the flip side‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOh,¬†huff, give me a break‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas helps drag me back to the cave.‚ÄÇMatt and others are already waiting inside. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look that great‚Äù, Matt notices us coming in. ‚ÄúHuff, what a coincidence! I don‚Äôt feel great.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I kinda went overboard,‚Äù Silas admits. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rare!‚Äù Seth says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm too tired to talk.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm going to get a dip in the bath.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I plug the tub and have the Hot Springs Slimes make space for me to sit in it.‚ÄÇThe hot water from my hot spring slowly fills it.‚ÄÇThe Slimes start spouting hot water to fill the tub faster, ‚Äúthanks, guys, I appreciate it.‚Äù I pet the Slimes.‚ÄÇSome of the Slimes are joining me in the bath.‚ÄÇWell, I don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶‚ÄÇHmm‚Ä¶ This is so good!‚ÄÇSlowly the pain fades and I start feeling refreshed. After the bath, I unplug the tub and I going back to the living room. ‚ÄúThat was just perfect. All the aching is gone, too.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds great. Can I borrow your bath?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course you can. Just plug the tub.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course, I might be a pampered prince, but I‚Äôm not dumb.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†that‚Äôs not what I meant.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôll see what I mean.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt enters the bathroom and promptly comes back. ‚ÄúYou have a hot spring in your bathroom?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I stumbled on a method to create an artificial one.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt have enough material for another one though.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre in a hurry, the Hot Springs Slimes can produce hot water as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou sure have a lot of uses for your Slimes‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so versatile!‚ÄÇI‚Äôve just discovered those Slimes can produce hot water myself.‚ÄÇThough I don‚Äôt think you can use those to start as an artificial hot bath.‚ÄÇThey like hot water, too.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. I‚Äôm back to taking a bath then. Later.‚Äù Matt leaves for the bathroom again.‚ÄÇOh,¬†I should tell the Slimes not to join him in the bath!‚ÄÇHere, done. ‚ÄúSwift, we‚Äôre about to play some cards.‚ÄÇDo you want to join?‚Äù Silas invites me. ‚ÄúSure, but I don‚Äôt know how to play.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.

I don‚Äôt feel great.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, I kinda went overboard,‚Äù Silas admits.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rare!‚Äù Seth says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm too tired to talk.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm going to get a dip in the bath.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p> <p>I plug the tub and have the Hot Springs Slimes make space for me to sit in it.‚ÄÇThe hot water from my hot spring slowly fills it.‚ÄÇThe Slimes start spouting hot water to fill the tub faster, ‚Äúthanks, guys, I appreciate it.‚Äù</p> <p>I pet the Slimes.‚ÄÇSome of the Slimes are joining me in the bath.‚ÄÇWell, I don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶‚ÄÇHmm‚Ä¶ This is so good!‚ÄÇSlowly the pain fades and I start feeling refreshed.</p> <p>After the bath, I unplug the tub and I going back to the living room.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat was just perfect. All the aching is gone, too.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat sounds great. Can I borrow your bath?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOf course you can. Just plug the tub.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOf course, I might be a pampered prince, but I‚Äôm not dumb.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†that‚Äôs not what I meant.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôll see what I mean.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>Matt enters the bathroom and promptly comes back.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou have a hot spring in your bathroom?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†I stumbled on a method to create an artificial one.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt have enough material for another one though.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre in a hurry, the Hot Springs Slimes can produce hot water as well.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou sure have a lot of uses for your Slimes‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre so versatile!‚ÄÇI‚Äôve just discovered those Slimes can produce hot water myself.‚ÄÇThough I don‚Äôt think you can use those to start as an artificial hot bath.‚ÄÇThey like hot water, too.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see. I‚Äôm back to taking a bath then. Later.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt leaves for the bathroom again.‚ÄÇOh,¬†I should tell the Slimes not to join him in the bath!‚ÄÇHere, done.</p> <p>‚ÄúSwift, we‚Äôre about to play some cards.‚ÄÇDo you want to join?‚Äù Silas invites me.</p> <p>‚ÄúSure, but I don‚Äôt know how to play.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll teach you the rules.‚Äù</p> <p>I wonder what kind of card game it is‚Ä¶‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Cooking After the Hunt" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/23-cooking-after-the-hunt/">Cooking After the Hunt</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Card Games and High-Stakes Gambling" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/25-card-games-and-high-stakes-gambling/">Card Games and High-Stakes Gambling</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-mt-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
