I put in Mana to the boundaries of the space to stabilize it.‚ÄÇSlowly the Magic Space stabilizes.‚ÄÇThat was close!‚ÄÇBut still, it‚Äôs a success!‚ÄÇI open my eyes.‚ÄÇIt seems my menu agrees. Magic Space You have created a Magic Space. Please give it a name: ________________________ ¬† OK Cancel I name it the Evergreen Forest.‚ÄÇI imagine opening a portal to the Evergreen Forest. ‚ÄúGate: Evergreen Forest!‚Äù A smokey portal appears.‚ÄÇI walk through the portal.‚ÄÇI find myself that is the size I thought it would be‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs totally barren!‚ÄÇI feel the earth under my paws.‚ÄÇThe earth isn‚Äôt dry; it isn‚Äôt wet either.‚ÄÇI try using Forest Magic to grow a tree.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not working: nothing grows at all. ‚ÄúSwift?‚Äù Sain enters the Magic Space. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù ‚ÄúNice space, especially for your first time.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks.‚ÄÇThough I envisioned a green forest and not this barren wasteland.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just create plants from nothing.‚ÄÇYou need to bring in fertilizer from the outside,‚Äù Sain answers. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ I guess I need to out of this feline form for that.‚ÄÇHow do I do that?‚Äù I close my eyes and imagine getting back into my catling form.‚ÄÇI experience a tingling sensation all over my body.‚ÄÇWhen I open my eyes, I‚Äôm back to my original height! ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back to normal!‚Äù Sain exclaims, ‚Äúabout that ability: you should be careful about whom you reveal that to.‚ÄÇAnd you might want to cover up‚Ä¶‚Äù He points down.

The Slimes are happy.‚ÄÇI guess the Slimes just didn‚Äôt produce fertilizer because I ordered them to keep the sewer clean. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring you here regularly to produce fertilizer.‚Äù The Slimes answer by jumping in happiness.‚ÄÇI use magic to mix the fertilizer into the soil. ‚ÄúThat much fertilizer won‚Äôt do much.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôd need about five or six times as much to grow even just grass,‚Äù Sain says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have to wait for the Slimes to produce more, then. How do you know this?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned about it before.‚ÄÇYou should mix in some soil from the forest as well.‚ÄÇYou were planning on trying to cultivate Tarry and Wooberry, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAfter you told us about those only growing in forests.‚ÄÇI got the same I idea.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just, I‚Äôm not good with Space Magic.‚ÄÇWhile you can grow plants with Forest Magic almost anywhere, Magic Spaces don‚Äôt have the seeds you need for it to work.‚ÄÇSo you need to bring these in from the outside as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. Thanks for the information. I‚Äôll start by planting some regular trees, then.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have Silas help out, too.‚Äù This is going to be a long-term project.‚ÄÇWhile I could use the help, this is something I ought to do myself. ‚ÄúThanks, you don‚Äôt have to do that‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, we insist.‚Äù Somehow, I get the feeling everyone is way into teaching me things‚Ä¶‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs poke a little. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre helping me by teaching this much.‚ÄÇBut at this point, it feels like you all have some greater motive.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sharp,‚Äù Silas enters the Magic Space, ‚Äúyes, you might be right.‚ÄÇWe do have a slight motive.‚Äù ‚ÄúSilas!‚Äù Sain is shocked, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù ‚ÄúI just called it a motive, but it‚Äôs not.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs more like wish we share.‚ÄÇAs you know, Young Master is the second prince.‚Äù A wish they share? ‚ÄúYes, what does it have to do with him?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ when he comes of age, he‚Äôs supposed to become an adventurer for a while‚Ä¶‚Äù Silas struggles with his words. ‚ÄúI see. And you were hoping I‚Äôll join his party at that time?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt talk about it.‚ÄÇBut everyone secretly hopes you‚Äôll join him, even Matt.‚ÄÇWe didn‚Äôt talk about it because it‚Äôs nothing we can do something about.‚ÄÇIt is your decision!‚ÄÇThough I do have to say we enjoy teaching you.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about you guys? Can‚Äôt you join him?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not exactly his age‚Ä¶ And we‚Äôre not his close friends.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry if we offended you.‚ÄÇBut please don‚Äôt let it affect your friendship with Matt!‚Äù Sain looks very worried. ‚ÄúNo, no‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not the problem!‚ÄÇSo, when will it be?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be when he turns 12 () so in about two years.‚Äù Two years.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs quite some time‚Ä¶ Enough time to get ready.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not like I dislike Matt.‚ÄÇGoing adventuring with a friend sounds enticing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll gladly go adventuring with Matt.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs my friend after all.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks. It‚Äôll give us peace of mind to know you‚Äôre joining him.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn exchange, I‚Äôll take you up on my offer to help me with this experiment.‚Äù ‚ÄúExperiment?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, we still don‚Äôt know if Tarry and Wooberry will grow here,‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇWe all start laughing.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-hidden> Creating the Evergreen Forest </h1> <div class="d-none" id="talkify-title" aria-flowto="talkify-metadata"> <p>0xReki's Adventures by Night<p> <p>Crystal Down 1, Life in Avan Forest, Chapter 27: Creating the Evergreen Forest<p> </div> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left"> published on 2020-01-29, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-right"> written by , checked with , edited by </small> <div class="clearfix"></div> <small > As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 mt-2"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Swift Mittens, the Kitten" href="/01-life-in-avan-forest/26-swift-mittens-the-kitten/">Swift Mittens, the Kitten</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="The Large Bath in the Evergreen Forest" href="/01-life-in-avan-forest/28-the-large-bath-in-the-evergreen-forest/">The Large Bath in the Evergreen Forest</a> </nav> </header> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>I close my eyes and concentrate on my magic.‚ÄÇI need to create a space that is strongly connected to my magic.‚ÄÇI need to imagine what features my Magic Space should have.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs an empty space.‚ÄÇTime should flow at the same rate, just like it does in the world outside.‚ÄÇThe Magic Space should have gravity just like the world has gravity‚Ä¶‚ÄÇIt should have fertile soil like the world has fertile soil‚Ä¶ and air just like the world has air‚Ä¶ and weather‚Ä¶ just like‚Ä¶</p> <p>No, I don‚Äôt need a copy of the forest.‚ÄÇThis is disconnected from my surroundings!‚ÄÇI specify the rules.‚ÄÇI want eternal temperate climate spring weather!‚ÄÇThe soil should be deep enough for tree roots to grow.‚ÄÇThe ‚Äúsun‚Äù is just a fixed light source that has the same properties as the sun, should shine and darken in daily intervals just like the real sun rises and falls.</p> <p>Yes, this is the image I‚Äôm going with.‚ÄÇAs for dimensions, I need a height big enough for trees to grow.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs go for twice the height of a tree.‚ÄÇThat should be more than enough.‚ÄÇAs for the horizontal dimensions, I leave it variable.‚ÄÇI just let it grow with the amount of Mana I put in.‚ÄÇI begin creating the Magic Space.‚ÄÇI can feel it slowly growing.‚ÄÇI should be about the size of my room now.</p> <p>Oh, I still have a lot of energy.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs put in more Mana!
