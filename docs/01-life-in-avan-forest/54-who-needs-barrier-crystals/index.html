Ise,¬†the next village.‚ÄÇI thought having the prisoners would slow us down quite a lot.‚ÄÇBut we‚Äôre moving at the same pace as before.‚ÄÇAnd somehow, the prisoners seem quite afraid of Alfred.‚ÄÇSo they‚Äôre moving faster than I expected. ¬´Did you do something to them, Alfred?¬ª ¬´Nothing special, I just want to be scary so they don‚Äôt touch me.¬ª ‚ÄúAlfred seems to be able to use Intimidation,‚Äù Pat says. ‚ÄúI figured as such,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt explain why they are in such a hurry,‚Äù Kat says what I think.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúNot that I mind.‚ÄÇIt just means we‚Äôll actually reach Ise today.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs about that‚Ä¶‚Äù Sobe mumbles. ‚ÄúThat?‚Äù Matt, Pat,¬†Kat and I ask.‚ÄÇAs expected, Luna doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested. ‚ÄúI only know this by hearsay.‚ÄÇSeveral weeks ago, a wannabe tamer tried getting his hand on a rare Plumel.‚ÄÇHis attempts for making contracts failed.‚ÄÇIn his anger, he insulted the Plumel, which then kicked him in the nuts out of spite.‚ÄÇThey say he was unconscious for several days. I‚Äôm not a tamer, but isn‚Äôt that common sense not to insult whatever you‚Äôre trying to tame?‚ÄÇAnyway, I‚Äôd like to meet that Plumel.‚ÄÇIt seems quite a good fit for me!‚Äù We finally reach Ise.‚ÄÇAs Lecarvi and Sobe need to take the prisoners to the prison, they recommend us to stay at the Kitten‚Äôs Purr.‚ÄÇWe promise to meet later.‚ÄÇThey go with the guards.‚ÄÇOur group goes along the street.‚ÄÇEven though it‚Äôs the late afternoon, some stalls are still open. ‚ÄúBarrier crystals for sale!‚Äù an old man advertises his wares. I stop and have a look at the said crystals. Item: Barrier Crystal A Mana Crystal enchanted with a spell that connects with other crystals with the same enchantment to form a barrier that is impenetrable by monsters.‚ÄÇCertain configurations make the barrier stronger.‚ÄÇThis crystal can also be used individually, creating a short-time barrier around the user. Yes,¬†those are barrier crystals, the same kind as I used before. ‚ÄúBarrier Crystals make you impotent!‚Äù a nearby stranger yells. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I ask him, ‚ÄúWhy would that be?‚Äù ‚ÄúA recent study showed couples that use barrier crystals are less likely to have offspring the following months,‚Äù he answers. ‚ÄúOf course they would have fewer offspring!‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúpeople‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he interrupts Matt, ‚ÄúBarrier Crystals make you impotent!‚ÄÇSave your money so you can pamper that stupidly shiny plumb bird of‚Ä¶ Owww!‚Äù Alfred went ahead and kicked him. In the nuts.‚ÄÇHe holds his balls in pain and collapses.‚ÄÇI feel sorry for the vendor.‚ÄÇThe other guy? Not so much. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a dozen please,‚Äù I give an order. ‚ÄúSure. I‚Äôll give you some extra crystals as thanks to your Plumel.‚ÄÇThat guy was getting annoying,‚Äù the vendor answers as he hands me the products, ‚Äúyou see, Ise is the last town on the route I can sell those.‚ÄÇOver in Cogen they actually believe that nonsense that he spouts.‚ÄÇI just want to sell out so I have an excuse for not going to Cogen.‚Äù The guards arrive and question the bystanders.‚ÄÇI can hear a nearby villager saying: ‚ÄúHe insulted a Plumel. Again.‚ÄÇAnd yes, he spouted his usual conspiracy theories.‚ÄÇIf he had a Barrier Crystal, he wouldn‚Äôt be out now.‚Äù The guards break out in laughter.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúYou heard it. It‚Äôs his own fault.‚Äù‚ÄÇThey carry the unconscious man away without even questioning us. ‚ÄúYou mentioned Cogen,‚Äù Matt addresses the vendor.‚ÄÇ‚Äúhave you heard about other conspiracy theories going around in Cogen?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe biggest one is ‚ÄòThe vaccine against the Mad Cow Disease is just a ploy to weaken magic affinities of the villagers.‚Äô I have seen some villagers mixing the vaccine with powered magic crystals and selling it as Mana Potions.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow long have they been doing it?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt must be like several years now.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs crazy!‚ÄÇThe Mad Cow Crisis is barely one generation in the past!‚ÄÇWithout the help of the followers of Nature‚Äôs Bounty, we would have all starved!‚ÄÇI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the crown were to ban cattle farming after the next outbreak.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou think there will be an outbreak soon?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†just as last time, the animals and monsters are leaving the area.‚ÄÇWhen I was travelling from Farry, I noticed there were a lot of animals leaving.‚ÄÇThere are still animals here in the area, so I think this town is safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes the army know about that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚ÄÇEven if I were to tell them.‚ÄÇWhy would they listen to a random old man like me?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised. Anyway, thanks. Bye!‚Äù‚ÄÇMatt turns to the party.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the inn and check-in.‚Äù We move to the inn.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve been wondering: Why hasn‚Äôt there been any announcements by the temples?‚ÄÇI hear a ringing sound ‚Äî it‚Äôs mail! I discreetly open the mail. Mail Sender: ¬†Suscellu Subject: Mad Cow Disease Since we‚Äôre still debating I can‚Äôt tell you much.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll tell you some historic things about it, instead.‚ÄÇThe outbreak one generation ago was a biomagical weapon accident.‚ÄÇThus it‚Äôs something resulting from the actions of mortals.‚ÄÇBack then, we didn‚Äôt intervene. All I can say is: listen to the elderly. Regards, Suscellu We arrive at the inn and check-in.‚ÄÇI think I heard something about dinner being served soon.‚ÄÇInstead of going to the hall, Matt immediately drags us into his room upstairs and locks the door.‚ÄÇHe places a crystal orb on the table and let‚Äôs magic flow through it.‚ÄÇAfter a few seconds, the face of Timon, Matt‚Äôs father, appears in the orb. ‚ÄúIt must be urgent if you use the orb.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have reason to believe there will be a Mad Cow Disease outbreak in Cogen soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn what basis is this?‚Äù ‚ÄúAccording to the peddler I questioned, Cogen seems not to have used the vaccine we provide for several years.‚ÄÇAnimals and Monsters are leaving the area just like before the last outbreak.‚Äù ‚ÄúThose are quite valid points.‚ÄÇBut if something of a big scale like you think will happen.‚ÄÇWhy haven‚Äôt the gods sent us an oracle?‚Äù ‚ÄúPardon me interrupting,‚Äù I calmly start explaining.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúAccording to the knowledge I received as the Keeper, the gods consider the Mad Cow Disease a mortal-made biomagical weapon.‚ÄÇThus, if it were to return, the gods are bound to neutrality and are not to act.‚ÄÇWith that being said, I believe the peddler we talked to has a point.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you receive an oracle?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúHow did you‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm supposed to say no, you know?!‚Äù I answer with noticeable bad acting. Timon gasps, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll send troops under the guise of training.‚Äù Timon‚Äôs face fades and the crystal shatters. ‚ÄúI was about to tell him the oracle only contained historic information,‚Äù I continue. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that changes anything,‚Äù Matt answers.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 54: Who Needs Barrier Crystals?!"> Who Needs Barrier Crystals?! </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-07-20, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/jayfeather#2293" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">jayfeather</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Robbery on Avan Highway" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/53-robbery-on-avan-highway/">Robbery on Avan Highway</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Banter At the Inn" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/55-banter-at-the-inn/">Banter At the Inn</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>We slowly make our way towards Ise,¬†the next village.‚ÄÇI thought having the prisoners would slow us down quite a lot.‚ÄÇBut we‚Äôre moving at the same pace as before.‚ÄÇAnd somehow, the prisoners seem quite afraid of Alfred.‚ÄÇSo they‚Äôre moving faster than I expected.</p> <p><em>¬´Did you do something to them, Alfred?¬ª</em></p> <p><em>¬´Nothing special, I just want to be scary so they don‚Äôt touch me.¬ª</em></p> <p>‚ÄúAlfred seems to be able to use <em>Intimidation</em>,‚Äù Pat says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI figured as such,‚Äù I answer.</p> <p>‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt explain why they are in such a hurry,‚Äù Kat says what I think.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúNot that I mind.‚ÄÇIt just means we‚Äôll actually reach Ise today.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs about that‚Ä¶‚Äù Sobe mumbles.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat?‚Äù Matt, Pat,¬†Kat and I ask.‚ÄÇAs expected, Luna doesn‚Äôt seem to be interested.</p> <p>‚ÄúI only know this by hearsay.‚ÄÇSeveral weeks ago, a wannabe tamer tried getting his hand on a rare Plumel.‚ÄÇHis attempts for making contracts failed.‚ÄÇIn his anger, he insulted the Plumel, which then kicked him in the nuts out of spite.‚ÄÇThey say he was unconscious for several days.</p> <p>I‚Äôm not a tamer, but isn‚Äôt that common sense not to insult whatever you‚Äôre trying to tame?‚ÄÇAnyway, I‚Äôd like to meet that Plumel.‚ÄÇIt seems quite a good fit for me!‚Äù</p> <p>We finally reach Ise.‚ÄÇAs Lecarvi and Sobe need to take the prisoners to the prison, they recommend us to stay at the Kitten‚Äôs Purr.‚ÄÇWe promise to meet later.‚ÄÇThey go with the guards.‚ÄÇOur group goes along the street.‚ÄÇEven though it‚Äôs the late afternoon, some stalls are still open.</p> <p>‚ÄúBarrier crystals for sale!‚Äù an old man advertises his wares.</p> <p>I stop and have a look at the said crystals.</p> <blockquote class="interface"> <p>Item: Barrier Crystal</p> <p>A Mana Crystal enchanted with a spell that connects with other crystals with the same enchantment to form a barrier that is impenetrable by monsters.‚ÄÇCertain configurations make the barrier stronger.‚ÄÇThis crystal can also be used individually, creating a short-time barrier around the user.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes,¬†those are barrier crystals, the same kind as I used before.</p> <p>‚ÄúBarrier Crystals make you impotent!‚Äù a nearby stranger yells.</p> <p>‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I ask him, ‚ÄúWhy would that be?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúA recent study showed couples that use barrier crystals are less likely to have offspring the following months,‚Äù he answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúOf course they would have fewer offspring!‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúpeople‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he interrupts Matt, ‚ÄúBarrier Crystals make you impotent!‚ÄÇSave your money so you can pamper that stupidly shiny plumb bird of‚Ä¶ Owww!‚Äù</p> <p>Alfred went ahead and kicked him.

I discreetly open the mail.</p> <blockquote class="interface"> <p>Mail<br /> Sender: ¬†Suscellu<br /> Subject: Mad Cow Disease</p> <p>Since we‚Äôre still debating I can‚Äôt tell you much.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll tell you some historic things about it, instead.‚ÄÇThe outbreak one generation ago was a biomagical weapon accident.‚ÄÇThus it‚Äôs something resulting from the actions of mortals.‚ÄÇBack then, we didn‚Äôt intervene.</p> <p>All I can say is: listen to the elderly.</p> <p>Regards, Suscellu</p> </blockquote> <p>We arrive at the inn and check-in.‚ÄÇI think I heard something about dinner being served soon.‚ÄÇInstead of going to the hall, Matt immediately drags us into his room upstairs and locks the door.‚ÄÇHe places a crystal orb on the table and let‚Äôs magic flow through it.‚ÄÇAfter a few seconds, the face of Timon, Matt‚Äôs father, appears in the orb.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt must be urgent if you use the orb.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI have reason to believe there will be a Mad Cow Disease outbreak in Cogen soon.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOn what basis is this?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAccording to the peddler I questioned, Cogen seems not to have used the vaccine we provide for several years.‚ÄÇAnimals and Monsters are leaving the area just like before the last outbreak.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThose are quite valid points.‚ÄÇBut if something of a big scale like you think will happen.‚ÄÇWhy haven‚Äôt the gods sent us an oracle?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúPardon me interrupting,‚Äù I calmly start explaining.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúAccording to the knowledge I received as the Keeper, the gods consider the Mad Cow Disease a mortal-made biomagical weapon.‚ÄÇThus, if it were to return, the gods are bound to neutrality and are not to act.‚ÄÇWith that being said, I believe the peddler we talked to has a point.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDid you receive an oracle?‚Äù Matt asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúHow did you‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm supposed to say no, you know?!‚Äù I answer with noticeable bad acting.</p> <p>Timon gasps, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll send troops under the guise of training.‚Äù</p> <p>Timon‚Äôs face fades and the crystal shatters.</p> <p>‚ÄúI was about to tell him the oracle only contained historic information,‚Äù I continue.</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that changes anything,‚Äù Matt answers.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Robbery on Avan Highway" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/53-robbery-on-avan-highway/">Robbery on Avan Highway</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Banter At the Inn" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/55-banter-at-the-inn/">Banter At the Inn</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="qu·ªëc Th√°i ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">qu·ªëc Th√°i ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
