I need to go to the city for that, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†yeah‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a hermit.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†no, the gods told me, I can leave the forest any time I want.‚ÄÇI just need to be politically neutral.‚ÄÇFor now, I just enjoy living here on my own.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe gods?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I just received an oracle this night.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn oracle? Is something about to happen?‚Äù For some reason, they are quite riled up. ‚ÄúNo,¬†it was just the formal appointment to be the Keeper of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇAnd the long explanation of what kinds of duties and privileges that entails.‚ÄÇIn my case, the most important thing is staying politically neutral.‚ÄÇRetreating to the forest is just a means to help me with that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ So you can leave the forest‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I can.‚ÄÇYou seemed quite shocked about the oracle part.‚ÄÇIs that something unusual?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚ÄÇUsually, we only hear about oracles when something big is about to happen.‚ÄÇI wouldn‚Äôt know if mediums receive a formal appointment from the gods,‚Äù Matt explains. ‚ÄúWell, it might just be an exception.‚ÄÇThe position is the Keeper of the Crystal Down after all,‚Äù Seth says. ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right, Seth.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs about time we left for the hunt.‚ÄÇRaiden, where are we hunting today?‚Äù ‚ÄúErr? You‚Äôre leaving that to Raiden?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not? It worked out great so far.‚Äù Raiden flies out of the cave and comes directly back. ¬´There‚Äôs trouble in the forest.¬ª ‚ÄúTrouble in the forest?‚Äù I repeat so the others can hear. ¬´It‚Äôs quite an evil presence.¬ª At that moment, I hear the ringing of a new mail.‚ÄÇI try to open it discreetly. Mail Sender: Suscellu Subject: Dangerous Monster in the Forest ‚Äî Subjugation Request Good morning, Swift!‚ÄÇA Giant Rabbit in the Avan Forest has just come to my attention.‚ÄÇWould you and your friends kindly dispose of it?‚ÄÇYou were going for a hunt, anyway, were you not? Regards, Suscellu ‚ÄúSuscellu sent a message.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs a rabbit in the forest he wants us to hunt.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Giant Rabbit?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†a Giant Rabbit.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs only that, I‚Äôm sure we can take care of it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre not that surprised about the rabbit.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, Giant Rabbits aren‚Äôt that dangerous.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just they can decimate fields and forests for years if it‚Äôs not hunted quickly.‚ÄÇSo it makes sense for it to be hunted as fast as possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see, Raiden, lead the way.‚Äù We follow Raiden to the eastern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇI speak what‚Äôs on my mind. ‚ÄúI wonder why Suscellu told me to bring you with me‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you ever hunted a monster?‚Äù Seth asks. ‚ÄúNo,¬†I haven‚Äôt. Is that a problem?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†not really.‚ÄÇThis should be the first Monster Hunt for Young Master as well.‚ÄÇSo how do you usually hunt?‚Äù Seth asks. ‚ÄúI make pitfalls with my Earth Magic and shoot them with arrows.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat could be a problem with the Giant Rabbit.‚ÄÇGiant Rabbits can dig through any ground with ease.‚ÄÇTry using Lightning Magic instead.‚ÄÇFire Magic should me effective as well, but we‚Äôre in a forest.‚Äù Lightning Magic‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just tell them. ‚ÄúI may have high levels in all magic, but I haven‚Äôt actually used Lightning Magic before.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been born with innate skill in magic?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I need to stay with that origin story!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not like I can just tell them I‚Äôm from another world! ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you can manage.‚ÄÇJust be careful not to zap any of us.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best.‚Äù The Giant Rabbit slowly comes into view.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs big; I think it about twice my height.‚ÄÇAt least it‚Äôs not white and throwing snowballs.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs calmly eating, a lot. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù ‚ÄúYoung Master draws its attention.‚ÄÇYou stun it with magic.‚ÄÇAfter that, you flip it on its back and kill it by stabbing it in the belly.‚ÄÇIf anything goes wrong, we‚Äôll jump in and assist you.‚Äù ‚ÄúO‚Ä¶ OK!‚Äù Matt answers. I can hear the tension in his voice. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you can do it,‚Äù Seth says. Matt moves around so the rabbit is between us.‚ÄÇI can hear him mumbling something, but I can‚Äôt make out what it is. ‚ÄúHey,¬†you damn rodent! You‚Äôre for dinner today!‚Äù For some reason, the rabbit reacts and charges towards Matt, roaring.‚ÄÇI guess it‚Äôs a Provoking Skill.‚ÄÇIt bounces off Matt‚Äôs shield. I try to think about a Lighting Spell.‚ÄÇChain Lightning?‚ÄÇNo,¬†my feeling tells me it would hit Matt as well.‚ÄÇI could enchant my weapons!‚ÄÇOr I could channel lighting through the blades.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs try and see what‚Äôs better.‚ÄÇI draw my short blades and close in.‚ÄÇI imagine my blades emitting electricity from their tip. ‚ÄúEnchant Lightning!‚Äù I jump and ram my blades into its neck.‚ÄÇI retreat several steps.‚ÄÇMy blades are still stuck to its neck.‚ÄÇThe rabbit turns towards me.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs all or nothing.‚ÄÇI stretch out my hand.‚ÄÇLightning from my hands. ‚ÄúChain Lightning!‚Äù A bolt of lightning from my hands hits by blades in the neck of the rabbit.‚ÄÇUpon impact, the rabbit convulses.‚ÄÇIt looks like it‚Äôs a success.‚ÄÇThe rabbit drops to the ground.‚ÄÇIs it dead?‚ÄÇSeth rushes over and flips the rabbit on its back with just one move. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not dead yet!‚Äù he says. The rabbit is still breathing.‚ÄÇMatthew draws his sword and stabs into the belly of the rabbit.‚ÄÇBlood starts spraying around.‚ÄÇFinally, it stops breathing. ‚ÄúSeems like it‚Äôs dead.‚Äù I pull my blades from its neck and try putting the body into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇIt works ‚Äî it must be dead. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt doesn‚Äôt sound that happy.‚ÄÇI look at Matt.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs completely drenched in blood.‚ÄÇI put my dominant hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúClean!‚Äù All traces of blood vanish.‚ÄÇMatt examines his clothes.‚ÄÇHis mood instantly improves. ‚ÄúThanks a lot. I didn‚Äôt know there was such a spell.‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 22: Giant Rabbit Subjugation"> Giant Rabbit Subjugation </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-01-17, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Meeting the Gods of Cratherion" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/21-meeting-the-gods-of-cratherion/">Meeting the Gods of Cratherion</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Cooking After the Hunt" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/23-cooking-after-the-hunt/">Cooking After the Hunt</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>‚ÄúDamn it‚Ä¶ Mittens!

Is something about to happen?‚Äù</p> <p>For some reason, they are quite riled up.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†it was just the formal appointment to be the Keeper of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇAnd the long explanation of what kinds of duties and privileges that entails.‚ÄÇIn my case, the most important thing is staying politically neutral.‚ÄÇRetreating to the forest is just a means to help me with that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ So you <em>can</em> leave the forest‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†I can.‚ÄÇYou seemed quite shocked about the oracle part.‚ÄÇIs that something unusual?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚ÄÇUsually, we only hear about oracles when something big is about to happen.‚ÄÇI wouldn‚Äôt know if mediums receive a formal appointment from the gods,‚Äù Matt explains.</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, it might just be an exception.‚ÄÇThe position is the Keeper of the Crystal Down after all,‚Äù Seth says.</p> <p>‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right, Seth.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs about time we left for the hunt.‚ÄÇRaiden, where are we hunting today?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúErr? You‚Äôre leaving that to Raiden?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy not? It worked out great so far.‚Äù</p> <p>Raiden flies out of the cave and comes directly back.</p> <p><em>¬´There‚Äôs trouble in the forest.¬ª</em></p> <p>‚ÄúTrouble in the forest?‚Äù I repeat so the others can hear.</p> <p><em>¬´It‚Äôs quite an evil presence.¬ª</em></p> <p>At that moment, I hear the ringing of a new mail.‚ÄÇI try to open it discreetly.</p> <blockquote class="interface"> <p>Mail<br /> Sender: Suscellu<br /> Subject: Dangerous Monster in the Forest ‚Äî Subjugation Request</p> <p>Good morning, Swift!‚ÄÇA Giant Rabbit in the Avan Forest has just come to my attention.‚ÄÇWould you and your friends kindly dispose of it?‚ÄÇYou were going for a hunt, anyway, were you not?</p> <p>Regards,<br /> Suscellu</p> </blockquote> <p>‚ÄúSuscellu sent a message.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs a rabbit in the forest he wants us to hunt.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúA Giant Rabbit?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†a Giant Rabbit.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs only that, I‚Äôm sure we can take care of it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôre not that surprised about the rabbit.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWell, Giant Rabbits aren‚Äôt that dangerous.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just they can decimate fields and forests for years if it‚Äôs not hunted quickly.‚ÄÇSo it makes sense for it to be hunted as fast as possible.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see, Raiden, lead the way.‚Äù</p> <p>We follow Raiden to the eastern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇI speak what‚Äôs on my mind.</p> <p>‚ÄúI wonder why Suscellu told me to bring you with me‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHave you ever hunted a monster?‚Äù Seth asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†I haven‚Äôt. Is that a problem?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†not really.‚ÄÇThis should be the first Monster Hunt for Young Master as well.‚ÄÇSo how do you usually hunt?‚Äù Seth asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúI make pitfalls with my Earth Magic and shoot them with arrows.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat could be a problem with the Giant Rabbit.‚ÄÇGiant Rabbits can dig through any ground with ease.‚ÄÇTry using Lightning Magic instead.‚ÄÇFire Magic should me effective as well, but we‚Äôre in a forest.‚Äù</p> <p>Lightning Magic‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just tell them.</p> <p>‚ÄúI may have high levels in all magic, but I haven‚Äôt actually used Lightning Magic before.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been born with innate skill in magic?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I need to stay with that origin story!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not like I can just tell them I‚Äôm from another world!</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you can manage.‚ÄÇJust be careful not to zap any of us.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best.‚Äù</p> <p>The Giant Rabbit slowly comes into view.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs big; I think it about twice my height.‚ÄÇAt least it‚Äôs not white and throwing snowballs.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs calmly eating, a lot.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYoung Master draws its attention.‚ÄÇYou stun it with magic.‚ÄÇAfter that, you flip it on its back and kill it by stabbing it in the belly.‚ÄÇIf anything goes wrong, we‚Äôll jump in and assist you.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúO‚Ä¶ OK!‚Äù Matt answers. I can hear the tension in his voice.</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, you can do it,‚Äù Seth says.</p> <p>Matt moves around so the rabbit is between us.‚ÄÇI can hear him mumbling something, but I can‚Äôt make out what it is.</p> <p>‚ÄúHey,¬†you damn rodent! You‚Äôre for dinner today!‚Äù</p> <p>For some reason, the rabbit reacts and charges towards Matt, roaring.‚ÄÇI guess it‚Äôs a Provoking Skill.‚ÄÇIt bounces off Matt‚Äôs shield.</p> <p>I try to think about a Lighting Spell.‚ÄÇChain Lightning?‚ÄÇNo,¬†my feeling tells me it would hit Matt as well.‚ÄÇI could enchant my weapons!‚ÄÇOr I could channel lighting through the blades.‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs try and see what‚Äôs better.‚ÄÇI draw my short blades and close in.‚ÄÇI imagine my blades emitting electricity from their tip.</p> <p><em>‚ÄúEnchant Lightning!‚Äù</em></p> <p>I jump and ram my blades into its neck.‚ÄÇI retreat several steps.‚ÄÇMy blades are still stuck to its neck.‚ÄÇThe rabbit turns towards me.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs all or nothing.‚ÄÇI stretch out my hand.‚ÄÇLightning from my hands.</p> <p><em>‚ÄúChain Lightning!‚Äù</em></p> <p>A bolt of lightning from my hands hits by blades in the neck of the rabbit.‚ÄÇUpon impact, the rabbit convulses.‚ÄÇIt looks like it‚Äôs a success.‚ÄÇThe rabbit drops to the ground.‚ÄÇIs it dead?‚ÄÇSeth rushes over and flips the rabbit on its back with just one move.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not dead yet!‚Äù he says.</p> <p>The rabbit is still breathing.‚ÄÇMatthew draws his sword and stabs into the belly of the rabbit.‚ÄÇBlood starts spraying around.‚ÄÇFinally, it stops breathing.</p> <p>‚ÄúSeems like it‚Äôs dead.‚Äù</p> <p>I pull my blades from its neck and try putting the body into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇIt works ‚Äî it must be dead.</p> <p>‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù Matt doesn‚Äôt sound that happy.‚ÄÇI look at Matt.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôs completely drenched in blood.‚ÄÇI put my dominant hand on his shoulder.</p> <p><em>‚ÄúClean!‚Äù</em></p> <p>All traces of blood vanish.‚ÄÇMatt examines his clothes.‚ÄÇHis mood instantly improves.</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks a lot. I didn‚Äôt know there was such a spell.‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Meeting the Gods of Cratherion" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/21-meeting-the-gods-of-cratherion/">Meeting the Gods of Cratherion</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Cooking After the Hunt" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/23-cooking-after-the-hunt/">Cooking After the Hunt</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
