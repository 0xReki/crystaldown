went to bed just like any other day‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHello, Swift!‚Äù I heard a voice behind me.‚ÄÇI turn around and see three people: an Ailuranthrope man, a Hume man, and a Hume girl.‚ÄÇThough she could also be a Neotes‚Ä¶ The Ailuranthrope is slightly taller than the Hume.‚ÄÇHe was grey hair and is wearing a white toga without stripes.‚ÄÇThe girl has brown hair and wears a toga with brown stripes.‚ÄÇUnlike the other two, the Hume doesn‚Äôt wear a toga.‚ÄÇInstead, he wears normal clothes in dark green.‚ÄÇAnd his hair is green? ‚ÄúThe three of you seem to know me.‚ÄÇWho are you?‚ÄÇAnd where is this place?‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start simple,‚Äù the Hume answers, ‚Äúwe are gods of Cratherion and this is the Divine Realm.‚Äù ‚ÄúGods? Divine Realm? Have I died again? But‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†we just called your soul here for a talk.‚ÄÇYour body still safe and sound in your bed.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†a talk.‚ÄÇIt seems the god responsible for reincarnating you did not do his job properly‚Ä¶‚ÄÇSo we‚Äôre doing this talk instead.‚ÄÇWe are our manners!‚ÄÇLet me introduce myself.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm Suscellu, the deity of Nature and Wine.‚ÄÇThe Ailuranthrope here is Glanuh, the deity of Vision and the patron deity of Ailuranthropes.‚ÄÇAnd this Neotes girl is‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúClayah, the deity of Shelter and Perseverance and the patron deity of Neotes.‚Äù So they are gods of Cratherion.‚ÄÇI wonder what they want‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get straight to the topic: you are way too skilled.‚Äù Clayah begins the talks. So it‚Äôs about my skills.‚ÄÇLooks like I need to lose some‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo do I need to surrender some skills?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†that‚Äôs not it.‚ÄÇYou can earn all of these, anyway.‚ÄÇThe real problem is: you have too many traits.‚ÄÇTo remove those traits, we need to kill you.‚Äù Shocked by that I drop to the ground.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt want to die!‚ÄÇI haven‚Äôt properly enjoyed life so far.‚ÄÇI start breaking into tears‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt fall into despair when I was about to be hit by a bus! Why now?‚ÄÇSuddenly, I remember the people I left behind‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI can never see them again.‚ÄÇAnd now I‚Äôm about to die again‚Ä¶ I full-on start crying. ‚ÄúClayah, you just had to bully him‚Ä¶‚ÄÇOh,¬†I see.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs finally sinking in that he died in the other world.‚Äù Glanuh pets me on the head. ‚ÄúKilling you would be the last resort.‚ÄÇWe don‚Äôt need to do that.‚ÄÇFor now, just keep on crying your heart out.‚ÄÇThe family of your previous life is important after all.‚Äù After what feels like hours, I finally stop crying.‚ÄÇI feel better after all that crying.‚ÄÇGlanuh continues the discussion. ‚ÄúHave you calmed down?‚ÄÇWe‚Äôve decided you give you a task that‚Äôs of equivalent value to the excess traits you gained.‚Äù ‚ÄúA task?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†but as far as you can see you‚Äôre already doing it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm doing it keeping to myself in the forest and building and cooking‚Ä¶‚ÄÇDo you want me to stay by myself for the rest of my life?!‚Äù I‚Äôve been making a place in the forest for fun, but I did want to leave that place at some point!‚ÄÇSo my prison is going to be that forest? ‚ÄúNo,¬†no, no, this whole situation is not your fault to begin with.‚ÄÇSo punishing you would be unfair.‚ÄÇYou must have noticed you‚Äôve become the keeper of the Crystal Down.‚ÄÇWe simply want you to take that position for real.‚ÄÇThat means you are to stay neutral in any political conflicts that humans might have.‚ÄÇAside from that, you can go wherever you like and do whatever you like.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm getting dragged into something? Or if I‚Äôm being targeted?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll send you a message to warn you if you might get tangled in some intrigue.‚ÄÇThe people of Cratherion should acknowledge your position and accept your neutrality.‚ÄÇWe‚Äôll only send you messages if it‚Äôs about political neutrality.‚ÄÇUsually, exceptions may apply. If people target you despite that, you do have the right to defend yourself.‚ÄÇIf all goes wrong you can simply retreat to any forest, preferably Avan Forest.‚ÄÇThe forest will protect you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any reason to decline.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt like getting involved in politics, anyway.‚ÄÇPlus, the alternative isn‚Äôt that alluring‚Ä¶‚Äù The two deities give Clayah a look. ‚ÄúThat was just supposed to be an explanation!‚ÄÇAs the patron of Neotes, I‚Äôm supposed to protect you!‚ÄÇNot to kill you!‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. Anyway, I accept.‚ÄÇNot getting involved in politics works out for me.‚Äù This is too tiring! Exhausted, I lie down. It looks like I get to live a normal life! ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great! We‚Äôll be giving you a trait to prove you‚Äôre accepted by us to be the keeper.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnother trait? Weren‚Äôt you just concerned with me having too many?‚Äù I sit up and look at the deities.‚ÄÇThey look more relaxed now.‚ÄÇAs if they‚Äôve stopped caring‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve accepted our terms: there‚Äôs no need to worry about you having too many traits anymore.‚ÄÇBesides, the trait you receive from us is the Oracle trait.‚ÄÇIt proofs you receive messages from the gods.‚ÄÇIn your case, it‚Äôs just for show since you can receive more detailed messages by mail.‚ÄÇIt should serve to deter people from getting you involved in possible intrigues.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this way too much to my favour?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat just shows how much your political neutrality means to us. Don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince the main talk is done. Let‚Äôs enjoy ourselves!‚Äù The three sit down near me.‚ÄÇSuscellu takes out golden cups from nowhere and pours in something for everyone present, including me.‚ÄÇI smell honey and alcohol.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm excited to taste it. ‚ÄúIs that mead?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it is. Come to think of it, you were quite fond of mead in your previous life, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù ‚ÄúI still am. But how do you know that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are gods, after all. Cheers!‚Äù ‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù I take my cup and drink.‚ÄÇThis is a very excellent mead!‚ÄÇI take out the fruit jelly.‚ÄÇI made several days ago from by Infinite Storage to share with them. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre OK with this.‚Äù They all eat.‚ÄÇClayah especially seems to have taken a liking to it. ‚ÄúOh,¬†this is tasty. What is it called?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called fruit jelly.‚Äù ‚ÄúJelly? I think that‚Äôs the first time someone made something edible from Slime Gelatine.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can just process connective tissue in animals to gelatine as well.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just way easier to use Slime Gelatine.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder what other tasty treats you can make if you have the ingredients‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I have the ingredients?‚ÄÇI need to get used to the ingredients here first.‚ÄÇThough I do wish I could have some proper vegetables and grain.‚ÄÇI just keep finding spices.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to what you make in the future.‚ÄÇBe sure to drop by from time to time and give us a taste.‚Äù ‚ÄúDrop by? Isn‚Äôt this the Divine Realm? How I can get here?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,¬†yeah, you‚Äôre mortal, I almost forgot.‚ÄÇThen how about we meet once every few moons?‚ÄÇWe‚Äôll just pull your soul here.‚ÄÇOf course, we‚Äôll send you the exact time in a message beforehand.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre doing that, get Rhygni involved as well,‚Äù Suscellu retorts, ‚Äúit would become quite a problem if you don‚Äôt invite the Deity of Cooking for those occasions.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôll do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best to prepare something by then!‚Äù ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs kinda too late to ask, but I‚Äôm underage, aren‚Äôt I? Is it OK to drink?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no law in Cratherion that prohibits that.‚ÄÇJust drink responsibly.‚ÄÇAlcohol needs to be enjoyed! Not wasted on drowning sorrows!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat being said, it‚Äôs about time to return you to your body.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm looking forward to our next meeting.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. Till our next meeting!‚Äù The next moment, my consciousness fades away.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 21: Meeting the Gods of Cratherion"> Meeting the Gods of Cratherion </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-01-15, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Slimes and Slime Gelatine" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/20-slimes-and-slime-gelatine/">Slimes and Slime Gelatine</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Giant Rabbit Subjugation" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/22-giant-rabbit-subjugation/">Giant Rabbit Subjugation</a> </nav> </header> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 my-2 align-items-center tts-controls"> <p class="w-50 w-md-25 mb-0">Text to Speech:</p> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>I find myself in a bright white room.‚ÄÇHow did I get here?‚ÄÇAs far as I know, I just went to bed just like any other day‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúHello, Swift!‚Äù</p> <p>I heard a voice behind me.‚ÄÇI turn around and see three people: an Ailuranthrope man, a Hume man, and a Hume girl.‚ÄÇThough she could also be a Neotes‚Ä¶</p> <p>The Ailuranthrope is slightly taller than the Hume.‚ÄÇHe was grey hair and is wearing a white toga without stripes.‚ÄÇThe girl has brown hair and wears a toga with brown stripes.‚ÄÇUnlike the other two, the Hume doesn‚Äôt wear a toga.‚ÄÇInstead, he wears normal clothes in dark green.‚ÄÇAnd his hair is green?</p> <p>‚ÄúThe three of you seem to know me.‚ÄÇWho are you?‚ÄÇAnd where is this place?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start simple,‚Äù the Hume answers, ‚Äúwe are gods of Cratherion and this is the Divine Realm.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúGods?

Weren‚Äôt you just concerned with me having too many?‚Äù</p> <p>I sit up and look at the deities.‚ÄÇThey look more relaxed now.‚ÄÇAs if they‚Äôve stopped caring‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve accepted our terms: there‚Äôs no need to worry about you having too many traits anymore.‚ÄÇBesides, the trait you receive from us is the Oracle trait.‚ÄÇIt proofs you receive messages from the gods.‚ÄÇIn your case, it‚Äôs just for show since you can receive more detailed messages by mail.‚ÄÇIt should serve to deter people from getting you involved in possible intrigues.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this way too much to my favour?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat just shows how much your political neutrality means to us. Don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSince the main talk is done. Let‚Äôs enjoy ourselves!‚Äù</p> <p>The three sit down near me.‚ÄÇSuscellu takes out golden cups from nowhere and pours in something for everyone present, including me.‚ÄÇI smell honey and alcohol.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm excited to taste it.</p> <p>‚ÄúIs that mead?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†it is. Come to think of it, you were quite fond of mead in your previous life, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI still am. But how do you know that?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWe are gods, after all. Cheers!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù</p> <p>I take my cup and drink.‚ÄÇThis is a very excellent mead!‚ÄÇI take out the fruit jelly.‚ÄÇI made several days ago from by Infinite Storage to share with them.</p> <p>‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre OK with this.‚Äù</p> <p>They all eat.‚ÄÇClayah especially seems to have taken a liking to it.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†this is tasty. What is it called?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called fruit jelly.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúJelly? I think that‚Äôs the first time someone made something edible from Slime Gelatine.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou can just process connective tissue in animals to gelatine as well.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just way easier to use Slime Gelatine.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI wonder what other tasty treats you can make if you have the ingredients‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf I have the ingredients?‚ÄÇI need to get used to the ingredients here first.‚ÄÇThough I do wish I could have some proper vegetables and grain.‚ÄÇI just keep finding spices.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to what you make in the future.‚ÄÇBe sure to drop by from time to time and give us a taste.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDrop by? Isn‚Äôt this the Divine Realm? How I can get here?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†yeah, you‚Äôre mortal, I almost forgot.‚ÄÇThen how about we meet once every few moons?‚ÄÇWe‚Äôll just pull your soul here.‚ÄÇOf course, we‚Äôll send you the exact time in a message beforehand.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre doing that, get Rhygni involved as well,‚Äù Suscellu retorts, ‚Äúit would become quite a problem if you don‚Äôt invite the Deity of Cooking for those occasions.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôll do that.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best to prepare something by then!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs kinda too late to ask, but I‚Äôm underage, aren‚Äôt I? Is it OK to drink?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no law in Cratherion that prohibits that.‚ÄÇJust drink responsibly.‚ÄÇAlcohol needs to be enjoyed! Not wasted on drowning sorrows!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat being said, it‚Äôs about time to return you to your body.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm looking forward to our next meeting.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see. Till our next meeting!‚Äù</p> <p>The next moment, my consciousness fades away.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Slimes and Slime Gelatine" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/20-slimes-and-slime-gelatine/">Slimes and Slime Gelatine</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Giant Rabbit Subjugation" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/22-giant-rabbit-subjugation/">Giant Rabbit Subjugation</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="author noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
