I don‚Äôt mind.‚ÄÇIf he was here he‚Äôd say something like ‚ÄòBus,¬†Truck. Where‚Äôs the difference?‚Äô‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs big and has more than four wheels!‚Äô‚Äù she giggles, ‚Äúbut on the more serious side: Why didn‚Äôt you tell any of us about it?!‚ÄÇWe would have attended!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†it‚Äôs better that you didn‚Äôt.‚ÄÇHis family is‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs say they are very‚Ä¶ conservative.‚ÄÇThey don‚Äôt want random people from the internet to turn up.‚ÄÇThey were exhausting.‚ÄÇAnd now I need to look for a new flatmate I‚Äôm not looking forward to that‚Ä¶‚ÄÇMittens used to tell horror stories of bad flatmates‚Ä¶ I need to do that properly.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt you just have that place to yourself?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†I‚Äôd have to look for another place for singles.‚ÄÇBut a flat share for this place is just much cheaper!‚ÄÇRents are quite pricey these days.‚ÄÇEspecially for singles!‚ÄÇAnd I like the place I currently have.</p> <p>You should have seen where Mittens used to live before we got this place!‚ÄÇIt was more or less a cupboard on the fifth floor without an escalator.‚ÄÇAnd it was somewhere in the boonies!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt your place in the boonies?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just half an hour commute.‚ÄÇAnd our place is much bigger and in much a better location!‚ÄÇAnd he had to pay double the price as he did for our place.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh no, this isn‚Äôt great.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not looking forward to moving out from my parents‚Äô place‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI remember when we were looking for a flat.‚ÄÇHe suggested posing as a pair.‚ÄÇHe said some landlords prefer pairs over 2 people flat-sharing.‚ÄÇEven though legally it‚Äôs about the same.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†really? I might try that!‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Enter Lecarvi the Bard" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/46-lecarvi-the-bard/">Enter Lecarvi the Bard</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Dropping by Glorindamli's Armoury" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/48-dropping-by-glorindamlis-armoury/">Dropping by Glorindamli's Armoury</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-mt-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
