You‚Äôre here for your Prime Subjugation Charm. Let me get that for you!‚Äù Glorindamli walks to the back of the store. ‚ÄúWhat did you do? He usually is quite reserved towards new people!‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúNothing much, I just sold him some stuff,‚Äù I answer. Glorindamli comes back.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs another dwarf with him.‚ÄÇGlorindamli hands Matt and me a dagger.‚ÄÇMine is tinted dark green, while Matt‚Äôs one is tinted dark red. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a multi-purpose dagger made from the claw of that Giant Rabbit.‚ÄÇIf you maintain it well, it‚Äôll last you a lifetime.‚ÄÇAnd this‚Ä¶‚Äù he hands me a bundle, ‚ÄúThis is a sleeping bag made from the fur.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust for me?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúWell, as an Ailuranthrope Neotes you won‚Äôt be growing much anymore so we can just give you high-quality stuff without worrying about you growing out of it,‚Äù Matt explains. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇI can feel my face turning red.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt expect this!‚ÄÇSure, I knew he was up to something, but I didn‚Äôt expect to yield all the fur for a sleeping bag for me. I inspect the sleeping bag.‚ÄÇThe inside is made of the fur; the outside is a fabric.‚ÄÇIt feels water-repelling, like it‚Äôs made of synthetic fibre. ‚ÄúThis fabric‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting, isn‚Äôt it?‚ÄÇIt used to be a tent that has been imported from abroad.‚ÄÇSomeone accidentally cut the fabric so reused the fabric in this sleeping bag,‚Äù Glorindamli explains, ‚Äúit was a good idea to bring that fabric here, Snakkonlir.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what you used it for!‚Äù the other dwarf answers, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt I sell you that ages ago?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis fellow is Snakkonlir, he‚Äôs a travelling merchant.‚ÄÇThat Ailuranthrope lad is Swift, the one we talked about,‚Äù Glorindamli introduces us. ‚ÄúPleased to meet you,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the one who made that Maple Wine!‚Äù Snakkonlir exclaims. ‚ÄúOh,¬†you tried it? How was it?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was great, especially for your first batch!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not as strong as it could be, but it was still good!‚ÄÇWhen are you going to make the next batch?‚ÄÇI‚Äôd like to buy more!‚Äù ‚ÄúSoon, I guess, but the fermentation takes a while.‚ÄÇWhen are you here in town next time?‚ÄÇI can keep some in my Infinite Storage for you until you can get it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be great! Please don‚Äôt forget it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù I make a note: ‚ÄòSave Maple Wine for Snakkonlir‚Äô. ‚ÄúThanks a lot.‚ÄÇI need to leave soon.‚ÄÇThanks for introducing us! Bye!‚Äù Snakkonlir leaves the store. ‚ÄúThat went better than expected!‚Äù Glorindamli says, ‚ÄúI just gave him a bottle to taste before you guys came in.‚ÄÇNow I want to taste is myself.‚ÄÇI guess I‚Äôll do that after today‚Äôs work.‚ÄÇCan you sign here please, Matt?‚ÄÇI‚Äôll send the bill to the palace later.‚Äù Matt signs the bill while I put my stuff into my Infinite Storage.‚ÄÇGlorindamli sees us off, and we return to the castle.‚ÄÇIn the office, only Patrick is waiting along with a middle-aged man.‚ÄÇHe looks just an older version of Matt. ‚ÄúYou must be Swift Mittens, the Keeper of the Crystal Down I heard so much about,‚Äù he greets me, ‚Äúas you can guess, I‚Äôm Matt‚Äôs father, Timon Sitnalta.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no need for big formalities here.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a pleasure to finally meet you.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you, your Majesty,‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúWhat brings you here, father?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúI heard you‚Äôd be receiving your Prime Subjugation Charm today.‚ÄÇAnd since it‚Äôs my day off, I wanted to see what you got,‚Äù his father answers. ‚ÄúWe both got an all-purpose knife,‚Äù Matt answers and shows him his knife. ‚ÄúIt sure is a good knife.‚Äù Matt turns to me and whispers: ‚ÄúDo you still have some of that Maple Wine?‚Äù ‚ÄúI still have some bottles left.‚ÄÇYou want a taste?‚Äù I answer. ‚ÄúYes,¬†I think father would enjoy it as well.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs your first meeting, after all.‚ÄÇPatrick, can you get us some cups for the four of us?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Patrick leaves and returns a minute later with four cups, ‚Äúwhat do you need them for?‚Äù I take out some bottles of Maple Wine. ‚ÄúThis is some Maple Wine I made in the forest.‚ÄÇI hope it‚Äôs to your taste,‚Äù I pour some wine into the cups. Flynn appears out of thin air. ¬´Former Master has brought tasty water!¬ª Faryl and Felix appear as well. ¬´Tasty Water! Tasty Water!¬ª ‚ÄúGet a bowl as well, the Bunnyflies like alcohol.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs you know, Matt‚Äôs Bunnyfly is called Flynn.‚ÄÇThese two here are Faryl and Felix.‚Äù Patrick gets a bowl and I pour some Maple Wine for the Bunnyflies as well.‚ÄÇThey enjoy the wine.‚ÄÇMatt‚Äôs father says: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to test it for poison.‚Äù He takes his cup.‚ÄÇSo do we. ‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù We clink glasses and drink. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good!‚Äù Matt exclaims, ‚Äúno wonder the dwarfs are so keen on getting more of it.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exaggerating,‚Äù I protest. ‚ÄúNo,¬†I agree with Matt, it‚Äôs fantastic,‚Äù Patrick says. We look at Matt‚Äôs father.‚ÄÇHe looks as if he‚Äôs thinking of something. ‚ÄúIs something amiss, father?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúNo,¬†everything is alright.‚ÄÇThis wine is excellent.‚ÄÇThat I can say, but yet it somehow feels incomplete,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe dwarf did say it could be stronger.‚ÄÇMaybe I can let it ferment a little longer,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúother than that, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs something else I can do to improve it.‚ÄÇI was just experimenting with making wine, anyway.‚ÄÇI did not expect it to such a hit.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll keep on experimenting.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ Maybe one day you‚Äôll find what‚Äôs missing.‚Äù I hear knocking on the door. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Katherine,‚Äù I hear her say. Matt nods.‚ÄÇPatrick opens the door for her. ‚ÄúOh,¬†your majesty, you‚Äôre here!‚Äù she says upon entering.‚ÄÇLuna is with her. ‚ÄúYes,¬†I wanted to see Matt‚Äôs Prime Subjugation Charm,‚Äù he answers. ‚ÄúOh,¬†I want to see as well, can I?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúit‚Äôs this all-purpose knife!‚ÄÇSwift got a similar one.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see, maybe when we start adventuring, I should get one too.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not now?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúHigh society can be exhausting at times.‚ÄÇAs a noblewoman, I‚Äôm not supposed to buy all-purpose knives.‚ÄÇI only get to buy an ornate dagger to defend my ‚Äòhonour‚Äô, if I‚Äôm to even buy one myself at all‚Ä¶‚ÄÇOr I‚Äôm supposed to just take up the sword‚Ä¶‚Äù she sighs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to going adventuring with you.‚ÄÇIt means I can be free of this nonsense for a while.‚Äù Matt‚Äôs father starts laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚ÄÇAs an adventurer, you don‚Äôt have the luxury of thinking of what high society might say.‚ÄÇYou need to able to contribute to the party and be able to defend yourself at all times.‚ÄÇOverly ornate daggers aren‚Äôt helpful in that regard. I think I‚Äôve been intruding here for too much.‚ÄÇI hope to meet you again, Swift.‚Äù ‚ÄúI do hope the opportunity arises,‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇSince when did I have that phrase in my language repertoire?‚ÄÇI guess I‚Äôm just letting myself go with the flow too much again. ‚ÄúTill next time, goodbye!‚Äù ‚ÄúTill next time, goodbye!‚Äù Matt‚Äôs father leaves the room.‚ÄÇMatt turns to me and grins. ‚ÄúSo,¬†how was it like meeting my father?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very lax,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI think I should be leaving as well.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve been away from the forest for too long.‚ÄÇWill you be coming next week?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†that time I‚Äôll take my future party with me.‚ÄÇPlus one member of the guard, for formality‚Äôs sake.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Matt and his company escort me to the city gate and see me off. ‚ÄúTill next week.

Tasty Water!¬ª</em></p> <p>‚ÄúGet a bowl as well, the Bunnyflies like alcohol.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAs you know, Matt‚Äôs Bunnyfly is called Flynn.‚ÄÇThese two here are Faryl and Felix.‚Äù</p> <p>Patrick gets a bowl and I pour some Maple Wine for the Bunnyflies as well.‚ÄÇThey enjoy the wine.‚ÄÇMatt‚Äôs father says: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to test it for poison.‚Äù</p> <p>He takes his cup.‚ÄÇSo do we.</p> <p>‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù</p> <p>We clink glasses and drink.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good!‚Äù Matt exclaims, ‚Äúno wonder the dwarfs are so keen on getting more of it.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exaggerating,‚Äù I protest.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†I agree with Matt, it‚Äôs fantastic,‚Äù Patrick says.</p> <p>We look at Matt‚Äôs father.‚ÄÇHe looks as if he‚Äôs thinking of something.</p> <p>‚ÄúIs something amiss, father?‚Äù Matt asks.</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†everything is alright.‚ÄÇThis wine is excellent.‚ÄÇThat I can say, but yet it somehow feels incomplete,‚Äù he says.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe dwarf did say it could be stronger.‚ÄÇMaybe I can let it ferment a little longer,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúother than that, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs something else I can do to improve it.‚ÄÇI was just experimenting with making wine, anyway.‚ÄÇI did not expect it to such a hit.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll keep on experimenting.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ Maybe one day you‚Äôll find what‚Äôs missing.‚Äù</p> <p>I hear knocking on the door.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Katherine,‚Äù I hear her say.</p> <p>Matt nods.‚ÄÇPatrick opens the door for her.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†your majesty, you‚Äôre here!‚Äù she says upon entering.‚ÄÇLuna is with her.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†I wanted to see Matt‚Äôs Prime Subjugation Charm,‚Äù he answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†I want to see as well, can I?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Matt answers, ‚Äúit‚Äôs this all-purpose knife!‚ÄÇSwift got a similar one.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see, maybe when we start adventuring, I should get one too.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy not now?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúHigh society can be exhausting at times.‚ÄÇAs a noblewoman, I‚Äôm not supposed to buy all-purpose knives.‚ÄÇI only get to buy an ornate dagger to defend my ‚Äòhonour‚Äô, if I‚Äôm to even buy one myself at all‚Ä¶‚ÄÇOr I‚Äôm supposed to just take up the sword‚Ä¶‚Äù she sighs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to going adventuring with you.‚ÄÇIt means I can be free of this nonsense for a while.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt‚Äôs father starts laughing.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚ÄÇAs an adventurer, you don‚Äôt have the luxury of thinking of what high society might say.‚ÄÇYou need to able to contribute to the party and be able to defend yourself at all times.‚ÄÇOverly ornate daggers aren‚Äôt helpful in that regard.</p> <p>I think I‚Äôve been intruding here for too much.‚ÄÇI hope to meet you again, Swift.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI do hope the opportunity arises,‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇSince when did I have that phrase in my language repertoire?‚ÄÇI guess I‚Äôm just letting myself go with the flow too much again.</p> <p>‚ÄúTill next time, goodbye!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúTill next time, goodbye!‚Äù</p> <p>Matt‚Äôs father leaves the room.‚ÄÇMatt turns to me and grins.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo,¬†how was it like meeting my father?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very lax,‚Äù I answer, ‚ÄúI think I should be leaving as well.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve been away from the forest for too long.‚ÄÇWill you be coming next week?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†that time I‚Äôll take my future party with me.‚ÄÇPlus one member of the guard, for formality‚Äôs sake.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚Äù</p> <p>Matt and his company escort me to the city gate and see me off.</p> <p>‚ÄúTill next week.
