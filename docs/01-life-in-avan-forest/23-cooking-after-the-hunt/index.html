discovered that spell by accident.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt even know what type of magic it is, but it works.‚ÄÇI think that rabbit is more than enough to eat.‚ÄÇShould we go gather some fruits?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†let‚Äôs go.‚Äù We move to the southeastern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇUpon entering the orchard of fruits, the others stand there rubbing their eyes.‚ÄÇI remember, apparently, those fruits are rare. ‚ÄúThings are just different in this forest,‚Äù Matt finally says after a long silence. ‚ÄúOh,¬†you‚Äôre back,‚Äù I grin, ‚Äúare those fruits that rare?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†they are rare!‚Äù ‚ÄúAccording to my Eye of Knowledge, they only grow in forests.‚ÄÇDid someone try to grow them a forest yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll check when I get back.‚ÄÇIt won‚Äôt be easy to cultivate those then.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôd have to live in the forest to take care of an orchard like this.‚Äù Hmm,¬†I could try growing them in a forest pocket dimension.‚ÄÇI would need one, anyway.if I ever plan to leave the forest.‚ÄÇI need some safe space for my familiars. That‚Äôs another item for my bucket list. ‚ÄúYou guys rest.‚ÄÇLeave the gathering to us, it‚Äôs not like we helped much with the Giant Rabbit.‚Äù, Silas says. Seth, Matt and I sit down to rest.‚ÄÇMatt suddenly starts petting my ears. Purr, I‚Äôve started purring‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMatt!‚Äù I should stop him from petting my ears.‚ÄÇBut I‚Äôm so sleepy‚Ä¶ üôê üôë üôì üôí üôê üôë üôì üôí üôê üôë üôì üôí I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been sleeping, but I wake up on Matt‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúAh,¬†you‚Äôve come to. The others are about done with gathering.‚Äù We return to the cave.‚ÄÇThe rabbit is way too big to hang from in the kitchen.‚ÄÇInstead, I put the dead rabbit on the floor and I call the Blood Slimes out. ‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù , Matt inquires. ‚ÄúBlood Slimes, they eat blood.‚Äù They enter the body through the open wounds.‚ÄÇThose Slimes are surprisingly fluid. ‚ÄúUsually I let them eat the blood that drops out‚Ä¶‚ÄÇI did not expect them to go directly into the body‚Ä¶‚ÄÇMaybe I should have one of them accompany me when I go hunting.‚ÄÇThat aside.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not sure if I can really dismantle that rabbit‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs quite huge‚Ä¶‚Äù We break out in laughter. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy to help you with that,‚Äù Seth says. Meanwhile, the Bloods Slimes are leaving the dead body.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a strange sight.‚ÄÇIt looks like blood flowing out to form Slimes. ‚ÄúIn that case, I‚Äôll start preparing the other stuff.‚Äù I go to the kitchen and prepare some fruit jelly.‚ÄÇAfter filling the forms, I let them cool down on a shelf.‚ÄÇI take out some Poto and cut them to sticks.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll fry those later.‚ÄÇI drop by outside to see how far the others have come.‚ÄÇI need some fat to fry the fries, too. ‚ÄúGood timing, we‚Äôre just about done here,‚Äù Seth has noticed me leaving the cave, ‚Äúas I understand you‚Äôll be making food with this.‚ÄÇSo‚Ä¶ can we have its hide and its claws?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe hide and the claws? Oh yeah, sure. I can‚Äôt process it, anyway.‚Äù While I can easily get all the meat I need when I dismantle an animal, I still haven‚Äôt managed to preserve the hide until now, so I have never thought about what to do with it.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù I change back to the reason I left the kitchen, ‚ÄúI need some fat.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre done. You can put everything into your Infinite Storage,‚Äù Sain answers. ‚ÄúShould I store the hide as well? Time doesn‚Äôt pass in the Infinite Storage.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†please do. Keeping it from decomposing is very important.‚Äù After returning to the kitchen, I put some animal fat into a pot and light the stove.‚ÄÇFrom I drop in a little Poto crumb to see if the fat is hot enough for deep-frying.‚ÄÇEventually the fat around the crumb sizzles.‚ÄÇI put in the Poto sticks into a sieve and put it into the oil to fry. ‚ÄúThat smells great‚Äù, Matt enters the kitchen, ‚Äúwhat are you making?‚Äù ‚ÄúSchnitzel with fries.‚Äù ‚ÄúSchnitzel with fries? I‚Äôve never heard of that.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple, but it‚Äôs good. Fries are just deep-fried sticks of Poto.‚ÄÇAs for Schnitzel, I‚Äôm about to start with those.‚Äù I take out a chunk of meat and cut it to slices.‚ÄÇI mix some flour and eggs and coat the meat slices and fry them in a pan. While waiting for the right time to flip the Schnitzel, I prepare the Wooberry sauce.‚ÄÇBasically, it‚Äôs just mashing the berries and cooking it until it becomes viscous enough. After flipping the Schnitzel, the fries are about done.‚ÄÇI pull the sieve out of the fat.‚ÄÇTo let the fat drip down, I hang the sieve on hooks I have created on the wall.‚ÄÇGood thing I added those after I made the rooms for Matt‚Äôs group a few days ago!‚ÄÇAfter preparing enough for everyone, we sit down and eat.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt have a replacement for a lemon.‚ÄÇSo it‚Äôll have to do without.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not pork, anyway. After I‚Äôm done, we prepare the table.‚ÄÇI also pour a bowl of wine for the Bunnyflies.‚ÄÇWe sit down and eat. ‚ÄúYou were right.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs so simple, yet it‚Äôs so good!‚Äù Matt says. Everyone seems to enjoy the food.‚ÄÇAs do I.‚ÄÇHow long has it bees since I last enjoyed this?‚ÄÇI‚Äôm glad they like it.‚ÄÇThough I‚Äôm still somewhat unhappy about it turned out ‚Äî something is off ‚Äî but I can work on that some other time. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Swift? You look like you‚Äôve something on your mind.‚Äù It looks like it‚Äôs showing. Let‚Äôs just tell him. ‚ÄúNot much. It seems I forgot a step or two when I was cooking.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs been quite a while since I made that.‚Äù Now I remember!‚ÄÇI need breadcrumbs in the breading and I need to beat the meat before putting it into the breading. As everyone finishes, I get the fruit jelly. ‚ÄúThis is called fruit jelly.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat looks like an unusual dessert.‚ÄÇHow do you make it?‚Äù Matt inquires.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm somewhat surprised he‚Äôs so interested in cooking.‚ÄÇIsn‚Äôt he the prince of the kingdom? ‚ÄúYou melt Slime Gelatine and mix it with fruit juice.‚Äù ‚ÄúSlime Gelatine?‚Äù They seem shocked. ‚ÄúOh,¬†do you have some reservations against eating Slime Gelatine?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†no, it‚Äôs OK. Slime Gelatine is harmless, but people usually ignore it since it doesn‚Äôt help to sustain you.‚Äù ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that perfect for a dessert?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù We start eating the fruit jelly.. ‚ÄúThis is good! It just has the perfect level of sweetness!‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree with Sain.‚Äù We finish our dessert. ‚ÄúThanks for the food.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 23: Cooking After the Hunt"> Cooking After the Hunt </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-01-20, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Giant Rabbit Subjugation" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/22-giant-rabbit-subjugation/">Giant Rabbit Subjugation</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="First Day of Real Training" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/24-first-day-of-real-training/">First Day of Real Training</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>‚ÄúI discovered that spell by accident.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt even know what type of magic it is, but it works.‚ÄÇI think that rabbit is more than enough to eat.‚ÄÇShould we go gather some fruits?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†let‚Äôs go.‚Äù</p> <p>We move to the southeastern parts of the forest.‚ÄÇUpon entering the orchard of fruits, the others stand there rubbing their eyes.‚ÄÇI remember, apparently, those fruits are rare.</p> <p>‚ÄúThings are just different in this forest,‚Äù Matt finally says after a long silence.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†you‚Äôre back,‚Äù I grin, ‚Äúare those fruits that rare?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†they are rare!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAccording to my Eye of Knowledge, they only grow in forests.‚ÄÇDid someone try to grow them a forest yet?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll check when I get back.‚ÄÇIt won‚Äôt be easy to cultivate those then.‚ÄÇYou‚Äôd have to live in the forest to take care of an orchard like this.‚Äù</p> <p>Hmm,¬†I could try growing them in a forest pocket dimension.‚ÄÇI would need one, anyway.if I ever plan to leave the forest.‚ÄÇI need some safe space for my familiars.

Fries are just deep-fried sticks of Poto.‚ÄÇAs for Schnitzel, I‚Äôm about to start with those.‚Äù</p> <p>I take out a chunk of meat and cut it to slices.‚ÄÇI mix some flour and eggs and coat the meat slices and fry them in a pan.</p> <p>While waiting for the right time to flip the Schnitzel, I prepare the Wooberry sauce.‚ÄÇBasically, it‚Äôs just mashing the berries and cooking it until it becomes viscous enough.</p> <p>After flipping the Schnitzel, the fries are about done.‚ÄÇI pull the sieve out of the fat.‚ÄÇTo let the fat drip down, I hang the sieve on hooks I have created on the wall.‚ÄÇGood thing I added those after I made the rooms for Matt‚Äôs group a few days ago!‚ÄÇAfter preparing enough for everyone, we sit down and eat.‚ÄÇI don‚Äôt have a replacement for a lemon.‚ÄÇSo it‚Äôll have to do without.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not pork, anyway.</p> <p>After I‚Äôm done, we prepare the table.‚ÄÇI also pour a bowl of wine for the Bunnyflies.‚ÄÇWe sit down and eat.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou were right.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs so simple, yet it‚Äôs so good!‚Äù Matt says.</p> <p>Everyone seems to enjoy the food.‚ÄÇAs do I.‚ÄÇHow long has it bees since I last enjoyed this?‚ÄÇI‚Äôm glad they like it.‚ÄÇThough I‚Äôm still somewhat unhappy about it turned out ‚Äî something is off ‚Äî but I can work on that some other time.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Swift? You look like you‚Äôve something on your mind.‚Äù</p> <p>It looks like it‚Äôs showing. Let‚Äôs just tell him.</p> <p>‚ÄúNot much. It seems I forgot a step or two when I was cooking.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs been quite a while since I made that.‚Äù</p> <p>Now I remember!‚ÄÇI need breadcrumbs in the breading and I need to beat the meat before putting it into the breading.</p> <p>As everyone finishes, I get the fruit jelly.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis is called fruit jelly.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThat looks like an unusual dessert.‚ÄÇHow do you make it?‚Äù Matt inquires.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm somewhat surprised he‚Äôs so interested in cooking.‚ÄÇIsn‚Äôt he the prince of the kingdom?</p> <p>‚ÄúYou melt Slime Gelatine and mix it with fruit juice.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSlime Gelatine?‚Äù</p> <p>They seem shocked.</p> <p>‚ÄúOh,¬†do you have some reservations against eating Slime Gelatine?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†no, it‚Äôs OK. Slime Gelatine is harmless, but people usually ignore it since it doesn‚Äôt help to sustain you.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that perfect for a dessert?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù</p> <p>We start eating the fruit jelly..</p> <p>‚ÄúThis is good! It just has the perfect level of sweetness!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI agree with Sain.‚Äù</p> <p>We finish our dessert.</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks for the food.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Giant Rabbit Subjugation" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/22-giant-rabbit-subjugation/">Giant Rabbit Subjugation</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="First Day of Real Training" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/24-first-day-of-real-training/">First Day of Real Training</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
