<h1>Prologue: The Bus Factor</h1>
My boss has always said: “Properly document your project!
Even if you haven't finished it yet.
You could get run over by a bus at any time.
Whoever would inherit your project needs to be able to carry on.
Vash calls it the Bus Factor.”

“The Bus Factor?!
If that ever happens, I get to live in an RPG world!”
I used to joke each time he brought it up before finishing the documentation.

Eventually, he'd counter with: “Doesn’t getting to live in an RPG world require you get run over by a truck?”

To which I'd answer with “Bus, Truck. Where's the difference?
It's big and has more than four wheels!”

It has become like a running gag in the company.
Never have I thought it would actually happen.

{% scene_break %}

And yet here I am: I'm actually about to get run over by a bus.
A bus! Not a truck!

{% scene_break %}

Let's rewind a bit: I'm very sleepy after an all-nighter of online gaming.
I have been grinding towards my new legendary weapon in the latest MMO instalment of a popular JRPG series.
A few minutes after midnight, I've told myself “just a few more monsters before I go to bed”.
And before I know it, my morning alarm has already gone off.

I guess that means no sleep for me today! At least I don't have anything requiring much brain to do at work.
Lucky me!

I make my way to work.
It's a cold, foggy winter morning.
The weather forecast on the radio says something about freezing rain.
As soon as it goes back to discussing politics, I switch back to my music.
I don't like politics.
People can be quite a drag at times…
In politics, that means always.

I've almost arrived at work.
Suddenly, I hear honking. I look up at the traffic lights.
They are red.
So… I have crossed the road with red lights!
I'm way too tired for traffic laws.
Sleepily, I look to my left to apologize.
I see a bus rolling towards me.
Wait, hasn't that line of buses been in the local news lately?
Something about the local public transport company skipping on maintenance and failing mechanical parts?

Anyway, I'm about to get hit by that bus.
It seems like its brakes aren't properly working.
The Bus Factor is real!
I guess I owe Vash a smoothie.

Not that he can collect on that anymore…

But I still have 200 lines of code to refactor and start documenting stuff at all…
Why am I thinking of work?!
Forget that!
I still need to finish my legendary weapon!
I should have called in sick and continued grinding!

…

Well, at least I get to sleep now.
Maybe I even get to be in an RPG!
Prologue to a new life — at least I hope that is.

I close my eyes, preparing for the impact.
Please don't make it hurt so much!
And the next thing… I hear… is... chirping birds?!
And no honking?
And no traffic noises!
But I can hear leaves rustling in the wind.
I must have had a horrible dream!
I mean, really horrible!
Dreaming about your own death isn't a good thing.
Maybe I should look for a counsellor.
Since it seems the alarm hadn't gone off yet, I can continue sleeping for just a few more minutes.

I feel something touching my nose.
I try to grab it to feel what it is.
It feels… like a leaf?
That's strange!
Even though I like sleeping with an open window: my apartment is way over the treetops - it should be impossible for leaves to fall through an open window!
I slowly open my eyes.
This is not a familiar ceiling…
I mean, there's no ceiling at all!
Treetops come into my view — this is definitely not my room!

So did I really die after all? Is this heaven?
Or is this hell?
Or maybe this is just a lucid dream I'm having while sleeping half-dead in a coma?
That would mean I got run over by a bus after all.
But is this even a dream at all?
I mean, I can smell the forest.
I don't ever remember having dreams where I actually smelled something.

Slowly, I get up and look around. There are trees everywhere I look.
It seems like I'm in a forest.
Where could this place be?
The current temperature feels like a warm spring in a temperate climate.
Let's check out this place!
I look at the leaf I'm still holding in my hand.
While trying to examine it, I see something popping up:

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Maple Leaf
&gt;
&gt; ...

What the…

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Oh! I'm a Potato Cat!</h1>
{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Maple Leaf
&gt;
&gt; A Leaf from a Sugar Maple Tree.

Surprised by the window suddenly popping up, I drop the leaf.
Now that I see it, I can't help but wonder how I haven't noticed the icons at the edge of my vision yet.
Well, it's quite bare for a typical gaming interface…
This dream is not very consistent…
Let's check that interface out later.
I'm feeling really parched — I should look for some water.

I take a look around.
The sound of rushing water can be heard.
I follow that sound and find a river.
This is easier than I thought.
I walk up.
The water was so clear, I can count the stones in the riverbed.
When I scoop up some water, I realize that my hands seem smaller than they used to be.
I check my reflection in the lake and my jaw drops to the floor: I look like I did when I was ten years old!

“Is that for real?” My voice also sounds childish.
I touch my cheeks.
The reflection does the same move.
Is this my mirror image?
Let's see… I have… cat ears?! Black furry cat ears!!
So I'm a cat boy now?!
I also have a tail.
I move my hand to touch my right cat ear
Oh! I can actually feel myself touching it!
Same with my tail.
Since this is a new body, am I even a boy?
Let me check… Yeah, I'm a boy.

Having a closer look at my reflection, I see I have heterochromia: My left eye is shining emerald, my other is sapphire, a stark contrast to my dim black fur.
I need to check the interface right now!
Do I have a character window?
As soon as I think of it, a new window appears. Convenient!

{:.interface}
&gt; Character Info
&gt;
&gt; |---------+-----------------------|
&gt; |:--------|:----------------------|
&gt; | Name:   | Swift Mittens         |
&gt; | Age:    | X                     |
&gt; | Race:   | Neotes Ailuranthrope  |
&gt;
&gt; ...

I stop reading the window.
Unlike the existence of a UI would suggest, it looks like there are no character levels.
I got a new name.
My name in this dream seems to be Swift Mittens.
I have used Mittens as my nickname in online games before, so I don't dislike that name. But what on earth is a Neotes Ailuranthrope?!

As if to answer my question, two new windows appear.
It says Glossary in their titles.
Quite neat! I could get used to that.
Not that I have a choice here…

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Neotes
&gt;
&gt; A childlike race.
&gt; Grown Neotes are about the same height as ten-year-old Humes.
&gt; Some are blessed with innate luck.
&gt; Neotes can be quite obsessed with their talents or possession.
&gt; Due to that obsessiveness, they improve their talents faster and can achieve higher masteries at those talents than other races.
&gt;

I don't mind playing the childlike race in that other game.
In fact, I even like playing as a small mischievous bringer of chaos!
But it's an entirely different thing to actually become one!
I mean, having been average Asian, I have always been shorter than the average Caucasian and have grown quite conscious of it.
And damn my colleagues!
Why do they always put my stuff up on the shelves that I can't reach without a ladder!
But I digress: this is a whole new level of short!
The shortness of a ten-year-old! Permanently! Why!?
Anyway, let's have a look at the other window.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Ailuranthrope
&gt;
&gt; A werecat race.
&gt; Aside from featuring feline ears and tails, they usually differ little from Humes.
&gt; Most of them are blessed with strength and health.
&gt; Because of excellent reflexes and instincts, they can adapt to danger quickly.
&gt;
&gt; There are rumours of Ailuranthropes being able to morph into full cats and back.
&gt; However, no conclusive proof of individuals capable of that feat exists.
&gt;

So I am really a potato cat!
I guess I need to get used to being a shorty.
But I just remembered something: I am living in an RPG fantasy world!
This dream is awesome!
Who cares about being short?!

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>I Got Mail?! I Wonder Who It's From…</h1>
I hear a ringing sound, but I'm unable to make out where it comes from.
Very unusual for a ringing noise, it doesn't seem to come from anywhere in particular.
No matter where I look, it's always the same ringing every few minutes.
Am I hallucinating?
In the bottom corner, eventually, I see the envelope icon in a corner of my interface blinking.
Yes, I'm *way* too used to ignoring my UI.

But this UI is so minimalistic I can't help to ignore it!
I have only three icons: an envelope, a magnifying glass, and an information icon.
There's no minimap, no map icon, even no health and Mana bars, but I have a clock.

So I got a new mail.
I wonder who it's from.
I sit down and think of opening the letter I got.
As I expected, a new window opens.

{:.interface .pdf-allow-break-inside}
&gt; Mail\\
&gt; \\
&gt; Sender: &nbsp;Unknown Sender\\
&gt; Subject: Welcome to this world!
&gt;
&gt; Dear Swift Mittens,
&gt;
&gt; I do hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I am sorry to say that, as you have probably noticed, you have died.
&gt;
&gt; {:.pdf-force-break-before}
&gt; But rejoice: you have been reincarnated as a ten-year-old Neotes Ailuranthrope.
&gt; Welcome to this world, Cratherion!
&gt; I'll make it brief: you are currently in Avan Forest.
&gt; It's a comparatively safe area.
&gt; You should probably spend a while getting used to your new body before you go to the closest settlement.
&gt;
&gt; Enclosed in this mail, there are some supplies and basic gear to get you started in this world.
&gt; Since I ran out of ideas after making you a Neotes Ailuranthrope and I wasn't feeling like deciding for you, you can set your parameters and skills yourself.
&gt; I'm throwing in some extras for your trouble.
&gt; Have fun living in this world!
&gt; Try not to die so quickly!
&gt; You should be fine though, probably.
&gt;

So I have actually died? Sure, I was run over by a bus.
But everything feels so unreal I still think it's a dream.
Dream or not, so far I enjoy this.
Back to the mail: what's up with them telling me “Try not to die so quickly!”?
That doesn't bode well… not well at all!
Let's assume this is all real and proceed with caution. Even though I'm not entirely convinced.

I'm ten years old here.
Not that it really matters since I'm a Neotes — I'll permanently look like a ten-year-old.
I guess I have to get used to it.
On the bright side, I need not worry about growing out of my clothes.
Maybe it's a good excuse for… Never mind.

So… do I even have a storage function in my interface?
A new window appears. Great!
I move the items attached to the mail to my storage.
Clothing, food, camping utilities, skills, traits and weapons. No water.
Maybe there's some in the camping utilities.
It seems like I can choose 4 racial traits, 2 regular traits, 2 basic skills and 2 skill masteries.
I think I should actually have a look at my character window for some additional information soon.
I was merely quickly glancing over it the last time I was looking at it.

After that, I can choose what traits and skills I want.

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Setting up Camp and Discovering Numbers</h1>
I have a feeling it'll take a while to go through the things I can choose, so I should prepare a camp first.
From my previous life, I know it's a bad idea to camp too close to a river; especially on the floodplains.
Though not having to walk far to get to water seems convenient, but when it pours the water level rises.
And if you're lucky, your tent swims away with you in it.
If you're unlucky, you drown in the rising water.

I look around to trying to find a suitable camping space.
I spot a cliff. It's at least four or five times my height.
I walk there to get a closer look.
The area around the cliff is free of debris.
This seems like a good place for a camp.
I use the Box of Camping Utilities.

The box contains parts for a fly tent, some blankets, some tinder, some Barrier Crystals and several rolls of toilet paper.
There's no water again, but I got some toilet paper instead…
Well, it's not a problem since there's a source of clean water nearby.
Apart from the tent parts, I put everything else into my Infinite Storage.
I set up the tent, or at least I try to.

Fly tents are very simplistic.
So I thought it'd be very quick to set up.
But my limbs aren't moving where I want them to move!
I don't have any hand-eye coordination with this body.
So this is what they meant about getting used to my new body.
After way too long than I dare to admit, I finally succeed in setting up the tent.
Good thing it's only a fly tent.
If this were a more complex tent, it might have taken me till dusk to set it up!

So now I need to set up a campfire.
But how do I do that?
Every time I've been camping so far it has been either in someone's backyard or someone else has taken care of it.
For now, I have to be content with having what I currently have.
Rushing it would probably simply result in injuring myself.
Besides, it's not that urgent, since I have 30 Lottery Boxes of Food in my Infinite Storage.

From the position of the sun, I guess it should be about noon.
Looking at my interface, it says it's 0E:5X. 0E:5X?
Now it's 0E:5E.
What on earth is going on here?
I wait for the clock to change again.
Now it's 10:00.
Are the numbers different here?
I remember receiving 30 Lottery Boxes of Food.
I take them all out from my Infinite Storage and start counting them.

“One, two, three, four… thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six.”

So 30 is equivalent to thirty-six.
So 10 is equivalent to twelve.
That means my interface uses a base-twelve system.
From what I can see, X seems to equate to ten and E to eleven.
Is this how numbers in this world work?
I remember hearing about a base-twelve system in my previous life.
I think it's called duodecimal.
It's said it would make day-to-day life more manageable since you can divide twelve by two, three, four and six compared to ten, which you can only divide by two and five.
But since “serious” maths isn't affected as much, I didn't pay much attention to it.

I'll just have to get used to that.
But for that, I need to know the words!
How am I supposed to know what words are used?
I need a way to get information without attracting attention.
So 10:00 means it's twelve hours past midnight, though I don't know how long an hour or whatever it's called here is.
Watching the clock the minutes feel about the same as in my previous life.
So an hour is seventy-two minutes…

Since it's lunchtime and I'm feeling hungry, so I'm using one of the Lottery Boxes of Food.
I receive a sandwich.
Too hungry to care, I just eat it.
It tastes alright.
Though it could use some mayonnaise.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Choosing My Initial Traits and Skills</h1>
I sit down and take a look at my character information.
<!--more-->

{% include character/window.md character="swift-1-4" %}

That's a very bare character window.
As I said before, there are no character levels.
Currently, I have no traits but Menu, Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge and Infinite Storage.
I have no titles or blessings.
I guess the Menu traits are functions in my gaming interface.
From reading the glossary entries of my races, I would have guessed I'd have some racial traits.
So they didn't even choose those for me.
But that just means I don't have any existing traits to consider when choosing my initial traits and skills.
So let's have a look at the racial traits I can choose from.

{:.interface}
&gt; Book of Choice: Racial Trait
&gt;
&gt; Choose one racial trait from this fixed selection.
&gt;
&gt; {:.interface}
&gt; &gt; Ailuranthrope Racial Traits
&gt; &gt; {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Accelerated Recovery: <br /> increases recovery speed of all kinds
&gt; &gt; - Adaptability: <br /> temporarily increases status of choosing
&gt; &gt; - Feline Form: <br /> provides ability to shapeshift into a feline
&gt;
&gt; {:.interface}
&gt; &gt; Neotes Racial Traits
&gt; &gt; {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Mastery Obsession: <br /> increases maximum skill level to level 10
&gt; &gt; - Quick Learner: <br /> increases learning speed
&gt; &gt; - Lucky Devil: <br /> increases luck by greatly
&gt;

Neat!
Let's see.
Since I have four books, I can choose four of those.
To maximize my survival chances, I'm going with Accelerated Recovery, Feline Form, Quick Learner, and Lucky Devil.
Let's have a look at the regular traits I can choose from next.

{:.interface}
&gt; Book of Choice: Trait
&gt;
&gt; Choose one trait from this fixed selection.
&gt;
&gt; - Adrenaline Rush: <br /> boost increases speed when health is low
&gt; - Appealing Charisma: <br /> increases charisma by a big amount
&gt; ^
&gt; - ⋮
&gt; {:style="list-style-type: none;"}
&gt;
&gt; - Book Smart: <br /> increases understanding of theories
&gt; ^
&gt; - ⋮
&gt; {:style="list-style-type: none;"}
&gt;
&gt; - Nimbleness: <br /> increases agility
&gt; - Nimble and Precise: <br /> increases agility and dexterity
&gt; ^
&gt; - ⋮
&gt; {:style="list-style-type: none;"}
&gt;

I can choose two of these.
Again, to maximize my survival chances, I'm going with Appealing Charisma and Nimble &amp; Precise.
The latter sound like a typical trait that thieves have, though in this day and age, you'd rather call them *specialists for spontaneous involuntary ownership transfer*.
I can't say I dislike the sound of the latter term.
Every job sounds better if it's called a specialist!
Let's have a look that the skill I can choose from.

{:.interface}
&gt; Book of Choice: Skills
&gt;
&gt; Choose one skill to gain at level 1 from this fixed selection.
&gt;
&gt; ⋮
&gt;
&gt; {:.interface}
&gt; &gt; Meta-Skills
&gt; &gt; {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Fighting Skills
&gt; &gt; - Magic Skills
&gt; &gt; - Production Skills
&gt; &gt; - Survival Skills
&gt;

I quickly scroll over the categories to get an overview.
Meta-skills?
Wait a minute… I cancel the selection and try choosing a skill to master.

{:.interface}
&gt; Book of Choice: Skill Mastery
&gt;
&gt; Choose one skill to gain at maximum level from this fixed selection.
&gt;
&gt; ⋮
&gt;
&gt; {:.interface}
&gt; &gt; Meta-Skills
&gt; &gt; {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Fighting Skills
&gt; &gt; - Magic Skills
&gt; &gt; - Production Skills
&gt; &gt; - Survival Skills
&gt;

I can choose two skills to master and it looks like I can master meta-skills.
I grin.
I guess I've found my cheat!
It'd been even better if I had chosen Mastery Obsession earlier…
I mean I finally get to live in an RPG world and completely forgot about min-maxing!
Something I tend to do.
I should have put more thought into that…
Well, It's no use crying over spilled juice!
So which ones do I choose?
Survival Skills sound good.
Let me check.

{:.interface}
&gt; Book of Choice: Skill Mastery
&gt;
&gt; ⋮
&gt;
&gt; {:.interface}
&gt; &gt; Survival Skills
&gt; &gt; {:onclick="toggleAccordion(this)"}
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Camping
&gt; &gt; - Danger Sense
&gt; &gt; - Fishing
&gt; &gt; - Foraging
&gt; &gt; - Presence Detection
&gt; &gt; - Presence Isolation
&gt; &gt; - Trap Detection
&gt; &gt; - Trap Disarming
&gt; &gt; - Trap Setting
&gt; &gt; - Stealth
&gt; &gt; - Weakness Detection
&gt;
&gt; ⋮
&gt;

For some reason, half of the skills in this skill tree sound like thief skills.
Anyway, I'll go with that.
I think I'm good with survival chances, so I should be choosing some other skills as well.
Magic sounds nice.

Now that I've spent my skill masteries, I spend the remaining books to get all fighting and production skills at level one.
I should take a look at my character window now.

{% include character/window.md character="swift-1-5" %}

What's this?
While most of the maximum level skills are level {% include ruby base="X" text="ten"%}, some of those skills are level {% include ruby base="E" text="eleven"%}.
My guess is one of my traits increases the skill level limit on those.

I have magic skills now, plus I have the Camping skill on level {% include ruby base="X" text="ten"%}.
I should try making a campfire.
I should be able to build a campfire using magic.
But I still don't have any idea how to do it.
I don't know even how to use magic at all…
Let's try it, anyway, creating a stone frame… I touch the ground.
A certain phrase comes to my mind.

*“Compaction!”*

A cloud of sand forms in the shape of a ring around where I touch the ground.
I feel it'd too small and shallow for a campfire if that sand were to compact to stone.
So I imagine a slightly bigger and higher stone frame.
The ring changes size and the sand slowly compacts to stone.
Yeah, this looks like the stone frame of a typical campfire.
Is it done?
No, something in my mind tells me it's not.
So I keep at it.
After I get the feeling it's finally done, I stop and put in some wood.

Now I need to light it.
I could just ignite the wood directly.
What could go wrong?
I put my hands over the wood and imagine fire: hot and blazing.
I mutter the word that suddenly comes into my mind.

*“Blaze!”*

Oh! I get startled and flinch.
Good thing I do.
The next moment I see a flash and all the wood I put in has combusted.
The smell of burnt wood fills the air.
That was dangerous!
I should be more careful.
Let's try again.
I put in some more wood.
This time I put in some tinder as well.
I should light it carefully.
I put my hand over the tinder and imagine it smouldering.

*“Smoulder!”*

After a while, it starts glowing and smoking.
Now, I can either fan it until it turns into a fire or I pour more energy into it until it turns into a fire.
Let's do the latter.
I imagine slowly putting in more energy into the smouldering.
It intensifies.
The wood also starts smouldering on the place where it touches.
After spreading for a while, it starts burning.
Neat, I have made fire!
I sit down and admire my creation.
It was surprisingly difficult.
Good thing I started early.

Due to the mishap just now, I'm almost out of wood.
I need to gather more.
I go back into the forest and gather lumber.
I can't help but notice the animals in the forest now, I guess it must be because of to the skills I gained.
Since I'm not feeling any danger from them I ignore them for now.
I like the atmosphere of this forest.
Maybe I should settle down here!
The cliff where my tent currently is seems to be a good place to dig a cave.
Let's do that tomorrow!

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Digging My Cave</h1>
{% assign text = "twenty,,thirty-two" | split: "," %}
{% assign base = "18,:,28" | split: "," %}

After returning to my camp, I start planning my cave.
Actually, I want it to be more like a house: an entrance area that functions as a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen.
I think I'll need a workshop as well.
I experiment with several ideas I have.
In the end, I settle for the plan with a big entrance area in the centre that doubles as a living room.
That way I can expand it when I feel like adding more than the most necessary rooms.
That seems way too cozy for a cave.
No matter, I'll just have the best life I can have with a cave!
The sun has already set.
Time sure flies when you're busy!
My interface says it's {% include ruby base=base text=text %}.
Anyway, I put more wood into the fire to keep it burning.

I open another Lottery Box of Food.
This time I receive some Onigiri. Oh, the tuna is so tasty!
Since I've nothing to do, I observe the clock in my interface.
I think the minutes are slightly shorter than in my previous life.
But with the hours having {% include ruby base="60" text="seventy-two" %} minutes, the hours feel about the same length.

I set up some Barrier Crystals. As one could guess from the name, it sets up a temporary barrier.
That shield should protect my camp against wild animals for the night.
I get into the tent and get the blankets from the Infinite Storage and fold several of them to make a makeshift mattress and pillow and lie down to sleep.
Or at least I try to.

I need to go to the loo. I totally forgot about that…
I leave my tent and try to look for a suitable place.
This should be far enough away.

*“Displace Earth!”*

I dig a hole in the ground.
Yes, it's going to be a pit toilet. I don't really have a choice right now.
Now I need a seat.

*“Compaction!”*

There, I'm done!
Now the toilet paper I received turns out to be quite a boon.
After I finish my business, I wash my hands at the river and return to my tent.
But I can't sleep… I need to calm down!
I want to sleep now so I can get up early tomorrow!

{% scene_break leaves %}

I don't know when I've fallen asleep, but I've just woken up.
My back is hurting; I guess this world is real after all!
I'm in a new world — there's a whole new world for me to explore!
My clock tells me it's 09:04. I store the blankets and leave the tent.
The sun has already risen.
It's another sunny day.
Let's open another Lottery Box of Food and see what's for breakfast today: I get a bowl of hot cup noodles.
It's even my favourite brand! And it's already made.
And it also comes with chopsticks!
Slurp… So it's so tasty!

After washing my face at the nearby river, it's time to start digging my cave.
I should start with the entrance area.
I imagine a chunk the size of the entrance room, breaking down and touch the cliff.

*“Grind!”*

A nasty feeling of cold comes down my spine.
I immediately jump back a few steps.
Good thing I do. A wave of sand rushes towards me.
I should have thought of that!
This Danger Sense skill is quite useful!
What do I do now? Moving all the sand is going to take a while…
If I could only make it vanish somewhere!

Can I put it into my Infinite Storage?
I grab a small portion of sand and try to put it into my Infinite Storage.
The sand vanishes. Success!
I open the Infinite Storage.
The sand uses up one space.
I have a closer look at the item description.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Fine Sand
&gt;
&gt; {% include ruby base="18" text="twenty" %} dr of fine sand.
&gt;

Now, what happens if I store another a handful of sand?
The sand still uses up only one single space.
Great! I put all the sand into my Infinite Storage.
Now, I have created a big hole in the cliff.
I totally forgot I need a wall!
So I want a wall with a hole for a door.
The door should be three times as wide and one and a half times as high as I am.
The outside wall itself should be about as wide as my height.
I go to the mouth of the cave and take out a generous amount of sand from my Infinite Storage.
I can use this for building that wall.
That way I should even be able to make it look like I didn't forget the wall in the first place!
I stretch my hand out.

*“Compaction!”*

The sand compacts and forms a thick wall.
Judging from how it went yesterday, it should harden quickly.
After it's finally done, I go out and admire my work.
This isn't any good. This looks totally unnatural!
It's a block of uniform sandstone in the middle of the cliff!
I need a method to make it look like a natural cliff again.
I need the layers. I think I can do that by compacting more at the correct places.

*“Further Compaction!”*

There, now I have layers. It looks almost perfect.
I just need to weather the surface.

*“Weathering!”*

Yep, it finally looks as if I carved out the door first.
Actually, why bother if it's so easy to place a wall wherever I need it?
Next, I should be working on the kitchen.
The kitchen should only be half as wide as the living room is.
Like with the living room, I start digging and turn rock to sand and put it into my Infinite Storage.
Just this time, I grind smaller blocks until the hole reaches the size I want.
It takes longer, but the sand doesn't drop onto me.

*“Grind! Grind!”*

After I'm done, I re-erect a wall, separating the kitchen from the living room.
That has been more work than I expected.
But now, I have two rooms.
I want to have a campfire in my place, but I'm worried about smoke and suffocating.
The room should be big enough.
But to be sure, I need a way to exhaust the smoke and draw in the fresh air.

I need a chimney!
Carefully, I break the needed tunnel starting at the back wall of the living room all the way to the top of the cliff.
Now I get some sand from the Infinite Storage and create a chimney mantle.

*“Fine Compaction!”*

That's a different spell!
I think it's because this time I want a smooth surface and not a cliff finish.
But the spell takes just as long as the other one…
And it's finally done! Let's try lighting a fire.

*“Smoulder!”*

I put in some wood and light the fire.
I manage to do it in half the time I needed yesterday.
The chimney seems to work: the fire burns better than a simple campfire.
I'm worried about things falling through the chimney into the fireplace, but I'll take care of that later when I'm more comfortable with this body.
I don't feel like falling due to missing coordination.
I might be a cat boy, but that doesn't mean I can fall from heights without injuries like a cat.
Though that would be nice.
I wonder if there's a risk-free way to test that out…

Time to break a tunnel at the back of the kitchen as well, I want to put the oven there.
Come to think of it, before I dig out more rooms, I need some furniture.
Well, I still have lots of sand, so I just make some from stone.
Let's start with something simple: a table in the living room.

*“Compaction!”*

A stone table forms. This is way too easy!
And now a chair. I sit on the newly made chair.
Of course, it doesn't have a cushion, but still, it's a chair.
I'd make a bed as well, but I'm not strong enough to carry a stone bed…
Wait, I can just store it! I go into a corner of the room and create a bed.

*“Compaction!”*

{% assign text = "thirteen,,fifty-three" | split: "," %} {% assign base = "11,:,45" | split: "," %}
Just like yesterday, I make a makeshift mattress and pillow from the blankets I have.
Back in the kitchen, I create a table and a stove.
An oven might come later if I feel like it.

That will have to do for now.
According to my interface, it's {%include ruby base=base text=text %}.
I've gotten quite hungry.
Let's see what I get for lunch — I open another Lottery Box of Food — and I receive a pepperoni pizza.
And it's already cut.
That's a good thing since I don't have any cutlery yet.
Either the boxes take care of your circumstances or my Lucky Devil trait is working overtime.
Anyway, I should take care of getting cutlery soon.
But first, I need to consume this very delicious smelling pizza. Oh, it's yummy!
But I'm not that hungry, so I leave slices some for later.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Awakening Crystals and Forest Magic</h1>
Enough crafting for the day, it's time to survey the area.
I leave my cave and dismantle the tent and put the parts into my Infinite Storage.
After that, I take a look around.
The cliff seems only about a few hundred meters wide, meaning if I walk a little I can get on top of the cliff without climbing.
On top of the cliff, a beautiful meadow spreads out.

I find the holes in the ground are my chimney tunnels.
I get some sand from my Infinite Storage and create cowls and put them on top.
Done! Now I neither need to worry about things dropping through the holes nor wind pushing smoke downwards.

I eye a crystal the size of my fist nearby.
It's a deep green emerald.
I try to pick it up, but it's as if it's rooted to the ground: I can't move it all.
The crystal starts shining brightly.
It's blinding.
I have to close my eyes.
After the light dies down, I open my eyes again.
The emerald has turned colourless.
What happened?
Do I have an event log?
No, it doesn't look like it.
Out of options, I analyze the colourless crystal.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Drained Awakening Crystal
&gt;
&gt; A mysterious crystal that has the power to awaken skills and traits.
&gt; The colour of the crystal depends on the skill or trait the crystal is able to grant.
&gt; After use, the crystal turns colourless until it has gathered enough magic to grant another skill or trait.
&gt;
&gt; This particular crystal has recently been used.
&gt;

So I must have gained a skill or a trait.
Let me see… I open my character window.

{% include character/window.md character="swift-1-8" %}

I think I have gained the Forest Magic skill.
Neat! I think I also got the title “Druid”.
I think I can use that to hide the entrance to my cave.
Excited, I analyze one of the other crystals.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Awakening Crystal of Weak Constitution
&gt;
&gt; A mysterious crystal that has the power to awaken skills and traits.
&gt; The colour of the crystal depends on the skill or trait the crystal is able to grant.
&gt; After use, the crystal turns colourless until it has gathered enough magic to grant another skill or trait.
&gt;
&gt; This particular crystal has the ability to grant the trait *Weak Constitution*.
&gt;

Weak Constitution?
So traits and skills aren't always beneficial?
I analyze the next crystal.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Awakening Crystal of Permanent Invisibility
&gt;
&gt; A mysterious crystal that has the power to awaken skills and traits.
&gt; The colour of the crystal depends on the skill or trait the crystal is able to grant.
&gt; After use, the crystal turns colourless until it has gathered enough magic to grant another skill or trait.
&gt;
&gt; This particular crystal has the ability to grant the trait Permanent Invisibility.
&gt;

Permanent Invisibility? That's terrible!
I guess I have to thank my Lucky Devil trait that I happened to pick up something useful.

I have a closer look at the meadow.
There are awakening crystals spread all over.
I have a look at several other crystals.
I sigh… If they don't have detrimental effects, they have traits or skills I already have.
I give up. Given my current sample size, I don't think it's worth looking at more crystals right now.
Anyway, let's go back to the cave.
At my cave, I use my newly acquired Forest Magic to grow ivy to hide the entrance.

*“Growth!”*

But having ivy only in front of the entrance is too conspicuous!
So I grow more ivy across the whole cliff.
To make sure I can find the entrance, I put two boulders to several meters away from the entrance near the cliff.
Satisfied with my work, I enter my cave.
There's pizza waiting for me!

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Raiden the Thunder Hawk</h1>
“Eeeee!”

I'm greeted by a hawk.
My pizza!
The hawk is gorging on it.
So much about eating the rest of my meal later…
When I look closer, that hawk isn't a usual one: it has golden feathers.
Since my danger sense isn't reacting, it shouldn't be a threat.
I try to get some more information about it.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Thunder Hawk
&gt;
&gt; While Thunder Hawks typically don't attack humans, they can become a Class A threat if provoked.
&gt; Just as regular hawks, Thunder Hawks hunt smaller animals and monsters.
&gt; Should those not find any in their area, they might select to hunt bigger animals and monsters using their Lightning Magic skills.
&gt; It is believed Thunder Hawks can also feed on lightning regardless of its source, be it weather or magic.
&gt;

So it's a Thunder Hawk.
If I remember correctly, I should have Taming Magic at Level {% include ruby number='X' %}.
I should try it.
Slowly, I approach the hawk.
I imagine my energy gently touching and enveloping the hawk.
I stretch my hand towards the hawk.

*“Taming Monster!”*

Fine strings of light of all colours appear from my hand and circle around the hawk.
They slowly approach the hawk.
While it has noticed me, it hasn't moved.
It calmly continues eating.
Even as the strings touch it it's not retreating.
The strings of light form a ball around the hawk.
The ball shakes several times.
After the shaking, the ball is seemingly absorbed by the hawk.
Success! I know that because I can hear a sound effect that's just all too familiar.
An old-school sound effect, that has been around since 1997.
Good thing nobody is here to sue this world over copyright!

{:.interface}
&gt; Familiar Contract
&gt;
&gt; The contract with the male wild Thunder Hawk was successfully made.\\
&gt; Give the Thunder Hawk a name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\
&gt; <span class="btn btn-outline-primary active">OK</span> <span class="btn btn-outline-primary">Cancel</span>
&gt;

A name? I'm terrible at naming things.
Hmm… male Thunder Hawk… Chicken, I mean, Raiden!
It's just the first thing that comes to my mind other than Chicken.
No, I shouldn't call it Chicken like I used to do in my games.
I can't afford to give them uninspired names.

“Your name shall be Raiden. I hope we get along. How was the pizza?”

“Eeeee!”

I feel happiness radiating from Raiden.
I guess he liked it.
Since the pizza is gone, I open another Lottery Box of Food.
This time I receive some Duchess Potatoes.
After finishing my meal, it's about to get dark.
I put some wood into the chimney to light.
This time I should increase the output a bit.

*“Ember!”*

There, a working fire in a matter of seconds!
I sit on my bed watching Raiden flying about in the big room.
I totally forgot to check what I can do now that I have Raiden as a familiar.
I try calling Raiden over just by thinking of it.
Raiden does indeed fly over and lands on the bedhead.
He turns his head, looking at me, as if asking me what I want.
It looks like the experiment is a success.
I can give him commands without having to talk.
That will be quite useful when we go hunting.
I pet Raiden for a while before lying down to sleep.

“Good night, Raiden.”

“Eeeee!”

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Upgrading My Cave — The Bathroom</h1>
The next day, I'm woken up by something heavy dropping on to me.
I open my eyes wide and shoot up.
There's a dead rabbit on my blanket.

“Eeeee!”

“Yawn!” I stretch, “good morning, Raiden.
Is that your handy work?”

“Eeeee!”

Raiden lands on my bedhead and looks at me expectantly.

“Do you want me to cook this?”

“Eeeee!”

“I can't do that right now — I still need some tools. How about having that for dinner?”

“Eeeee!”

I wonder how Raiden knew I can cook.
He probably just assumed that after eating my pizza.
I take the dead rabbit to the kitchen and grow a vine to hang it from the ceiling.
Since I don't have a proper knife yet, I use one of the Choice Boxes of Weapon and get a short sword.
I cut the rabbit in the throat and let the blood run out.
Damn, it's dropping on the floor! I'm such a dork.
Quickly, I make a bucket from stone and place it below the rabbit.

*“Compaction!”*

{% assign text = "ten,,twenty-three" | split: "," %} {% assign base = "0X,:,1E" | split: "," %}
I move to the river to take a bath.
I send Raiden to do as he likes.
The sun is already high in the sky.
The clock on my interface says it's {% include ruby base=base text=text %}.
Brrrr…, the water is too cold… I should make a bathroom next.
After bathing, I change into a fresh set of clothes.
I opted to get a dark blue shirt, a pair of dark blue pants, and a dark green coat from some Choice Boxes of Clothing.
I put my dirty clothes into my Infinite Storage — I'll wash them later.

Refreshed, I return to my cave.
I should be upgrading my cave and dig another room!
Originally, I wanted to create a bedroom next, but having just experienced the cold water, I've decided to make a bathroom first.
With a bathroom, I can heat up water before using it.
Like before, I grind smaller blocks until the hole reaches the size I want.

*“Grind! Grind!”*

After I'm done, I re-erect a thick wall, separating the bathroom from the living room.
I take some sand from my Infinite Storage I to create a bathtub.

*“Compaction!”*

So I have a bathtub, but it has two major problems: firstly, it has no drainage.
Secondly, the surface is too rough and it seems to absorb a lot of heat.
How do I get rid of water after I'm done?
Well, I can just dig a drainage tunnel to the outside.
To keep my cave hidden, I dig the hole to open further away from the entrance to my cave.

*“Grind! Grind! Compaction!”*

I also create a plug. The first problem is solved.
Now on to the next problem.
If I could only add a glass surface to it…
Wait a minute!!
Glass is made from sand. And I happen to have a lot of it!
I take some sand from my Infinite Storage.
I imagine a coating of glass on the bathtub.

*“Vitrify!”*

The sand starts glowing red and coats the bathtub.
Is it melting?
No, it doesn't radiate any heat.
After the glowing dies down, I touch the surface of the bathtub.
Yep, this is much better!
I proceed to coat the stone plug as well.

*“Vitrify!”*

Since I can make glass now, I can make some tools of glass.
I go to the kitchen.
Glass is unsuitable for tools that are exposed to impact, but it's usable for all other purposes.
For heat resistant tools, I just need to make them thicker.
I make several knives, pots and pans.
While I'm at it, I also create some tableware and cutlery as well.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Food and Cooking in Avan Forest</h1>
After eating lunch — this time I get some grilled pork — I summon Raiden to the cave.
I need to collect something to cook the rabbit with.

“Eeeee!”

Raiden has just arrived.
He's circling around in the air.

“I need some fruit and berries, do you know where I can find those?”

“Eeeee!”

Raiden leads me through the forest.
We come to an orchard is the forest.
This place is full of trees bearing fruit.
They look like cherries, blue cherries.
I analyze the trees.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Tarry Tree
&gt;
&gt; This rare fruit tree cannot be grown outside the forest.
&gt; It has blue fleshy stone fruits.
&gt; Because of their exquisite taste, they are very sought after.
&gt;

I pick some Tarry and try them.
They taste like honey melon.
So sweet! I pick more of them and put them into my Infinite Storage.
I set my sights on the shrubs.
The fruits on those look like cranberries.
Just these are plum coloured.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Wooberry Shrub
&gt;
&gt; This rare berry shrub cannot be grown outside the forest.
&gt; It has small plum berries.
&gt;

I pick a Wooberry and taste it.
Yep, it tastes like cranberry.
I pick Wooberries and put them into my Infinite Storage.
I wonder, why does the glossary say those are rare? I mean, there's quite a lot of them here!
On our way back, I check the plants that grow on the floor.
I find some plants that look like green onions, but they are pink.
I analyze them.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Lanions
&gt;
&gt; This plant grows almost everywhere.
&gt; It's one of the staple herbs used in cooking.
&gt; This plant grows
&gt; very slowly.
&gt;

I break off a little part of a Lanion and taste it.
Unlike green onions, it's very salty and doesn't taste that much like onions.
Since I don't have salt, this turns out to be quite a suitable replacement!
I gather them as we move.
Getting closer to the river, I encounter fewer and fewer Lanions.
But I find more similar plants.
These are green.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Henions
&gt;
&gt; This plant grows almost everywhere where there's enough water.
&gt; It's one of the staple herbs used in cooking.
&gt; This plant grows very fast.
&gt;

I break off a little part of a Henion and taste it.
It tastes like garlic chives.
Since I have enough Lanions, I gather Henions until we arrive back at the cave.
By the time I arrive, the sun is about to set.
I immediately move to the kitchen and start dismantling the rabbit.
Raiden sits on a table and watches me.

Even though I have never done that in my life, my skill easily guides me through the whole process.
As much as I want to use the hide for something I have the feeling I've left the rabbit unprocessed too long so I my feelings tell me I can't make pelt from it.
For now, I put it into my Infinite Storage.

I cut the meat into chunks and season them.
I light the fire in the stove and fry the meat in a pan.
Mmm, it smells great.
I divide the meat into two portions.
I garnish the plates with Wooberries.
I push one of the plates towards Raiden.

“Here you are! I hope you like it.”

“Eeeee!”

Raiden and I both eat our food.
The meat ended up looking quite purple, but it was somewhat tasty.
There's still the bucket I used to catch the blood…
I put it alongside with its bloody contents into my Infinite Storage.

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>My First Hunt: I'm Hunting Some Boar</h1>
The next day, I decide to go hunting for the first time.
I use a Choice Box of Weapons and get a bow.
Luckily, a quiver of arrows was included.
I have Raiden show me a place I can go hunt.
I lie in wait in the bushes.
There's nothing here.

*«Raiden, are you sure this is a good hunting spot?»*

Raider lands near me and waits.
After a while, I see several boars come by.
I knock an arrow and aim.
And shoot. One of the boar shrieks. I smile — I've hit one.

Suddenly, I get a nasty feeling of cold.
I know that feeling — I better leg it.
While running away, I look back.
The boar I just shot is chasing me.
I barely even managed to land a hit, so it's alive and angry.
I need a way to stop it, and I need it fast.
Is there a spell I can use?
No, using fire spells would be a very bad idea.
Can I make a pitfall?
I stretch my hand towards the boar.

*“Displace Earth!”*

The ground where the boar is about to step suddenly moves downwards and the boar falls into the resulting hole.
I hear the impact.
Did it die?
I send Raiden down to check.
I can hear the boar shrieking.
Raiden comes back.

I get closer to the edge and aim again.
I see a smoky silver string connecting my arrow to the boar.
Just what is that?!
Even as the boar is moving, the string is stuck to it.
I take a closer look at where the string is connecting to the boar.
The colour of the skin is different there.
Is it a weak point?

To test that out, I carefully aim at that point.
I shoot.
I hear another shriek.
And something dropping to the ground.
Did it die?
Even if it didn’t, I now know where its weakness is.
So that's how my Weakness Detection skill works?
Again, I send Raiden down to check.

Judging from the feeling of Raiden calling me over, I think it's finally dead.
I raise the ground.
Yes, it's dead.
I put the dead boar into my Infinite Storage.
Phew!
That was more excitement than I wanted.
I should practice more.

I return to my cave and hang the boar in the kitchen.
I drain the boar's blood and use the same bucket from yesterday.
Unexpectedly, the blood in the bucket seems still fresh!
Is that an effect of my Infinite Storage?
I need to experiment with by Infinite Storage later!

Since I still have time until I need to make food, I start making a map of the forest.
I use some herbs and fruits I got yesterday to make colours and draw the places I have already visited on the table of my living room.
Of course, I mark the river blue.
I mark the orchard where I gathered the fruits green.
Finally, I mark the area where I was just hunting in pink.
To make sure the colours stay as they are, I seal those parts of the table with glass.

After I'm done, I go to the kitchen and dismantle the boar I killed.
Today, I'm making soup.
Having some bread or rice would be nice…
With the boar, I should have enough food for several days.
With the soup done, I scoop the portions for the day and put the rest into my Infinite Storage.

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Experiments with Infinite Storage</h1>
The sun is about to set.
Let's do some experiments with my Infinite Storage skill.
I know I can store quite an amount of sand in it.
I also know I can store things without touching them.
When I look at my Infinite Storage window, there's no indication I have a limit of any kind: even though I have a lot of sand, it doesn't even split into multiple stacks as I would expect.

I put one of my cups on the table and move several steps away.
I try to store the cup.
It doesn't work.
I get closer and try again until it works.
It looks like the range for storing things is about three to four steps.

Next, I try storing a burning stick.
A few minutes later, I take it out.
It immediately starts burning again.
So I guess putting things into Infinite Storage freezes time on them.
That's great!
I don't need to fuss about preserving food.

Next, I try storing the fire itself.
I do get the feedback storing something.
I try releasing it somewhere else.
I see some flickering where I released it.
So was it storing the agitated ions?

Can I store light?
Yeah, it looks like I can.
But just as with storing fire, I can't see any use for that.
I can just create Fire and Light with magic.
Although, I think I could extinguish a forest fire by storing away the burning trees.
Nah, that's a terrible idea.
If I take them out again, I have burning trees.

I try storing Raiden.
It doesn't work.
I guess I can't store living things.

What about the Awakening Crystals on top of the cliff?
I walk up to the place.
It's quite a nice sight: those crystals glow in the dark.
No, glowing is the wrong word.
They shine, they're bright enough to light the area.
I see a white shining crystal.
I analyze it.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Awakening Crystal of Light Magic
&gt;
&gt; A mysterious crystal that has the power to awaken skills and traits.
&gt; The colour of the crystal depends on the skill or trait the crystal is able to grant.
&gt; After use, the crystal turns colourless until it has gathered enough magic to grant another skill or trait.
&gt;
&gt; This particular crystal has the ability to grant the skill *Light Magic*.
&gt;

I already have that skill.
But I try storing it, anyway.
Oh, It works!!
I can bring this one to my cave and use it as a light source!
On the way back, I see several tiny glowing crystals standing in steaming water.
Unlike the other crystals, these radiate magic.
I analyze them.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Continuous Magic Crystal of Magic Water
&gt;
&gt; A mysterious crystal that continuously manifests a certain spell.
&gt; These crystals are sometimes found near Awakening Crystals.
&gt; Though no connection to Awakening Crystals has ever been found.
&gt;
&gt; The spell manifested by this crystal is *Produce Magic Water*.
&gt;

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Continuous Magic Crystal of Heat
&gt;
&gt; A mysterious crystal that continuously manifests a certain spell.
&gt; These crystals are sometimes found near Awakening Crystals.
&gt; Though no connection to Awakening Crystals has ever been found.
&gt;
&gt; The spell manifested by this crystal is *Heat*.

Upon reading the description, I store all the Continuous Magic Crystals.
I'm hoping to upgrade my bathroom with them.
I won't be able to do it today.
But putting them in my Infinite Storage and leaving them there isn't a problem.

My Infinite Storage isn't full, but it looks quite messy.
Can I sort my Infinite Storage?
Oh, I can add folders! And sub-folders!
That's great!
So I add several folders to keep my Infinite Storage organized.

After arriving in my cave.
I dig out a hole in the wall of the living room and put the Awakening Crystal of Light Magic in the hole.
I create a sliding door to cover the crystal to switch the light off.
This works better than I expected!

<h1>Cave Upgrade — Adding a Hot Spring and a Bedroom</h1>
The next day, I wake up early to upgrade my bathroom.
I mean, I wake up at about 09:00.
I add a spout where I install some crystals.
Then, I to add overflow protection to the drainage.

I feel the water flowing into the bathtub…
No, this is too hot and not enough water.
I add more crystals.
Now it's producing enough water, slightly too much for my taste, but it's too tepid.
Do things change when I change the arrangement of the crystals?
I rearrange the crystals in the spout.
I might just be imagining it, but I think the water output has dropped slightly, and the water got warmer.
Now it's perfect.
I have a hot spring in my bathroom!

I also create a toilet bowl and connect it to the drainage.
Why?
I noticed some Slimes take care of the waste.
I contracted them.
I remember Slimes multiplying quite fast, so I don't bother giving them original names, instead, I name them giving increasing numbers.
I enlarged the exit hole of the drainage tunnel so the Slimes can live in that portion.
According to my interface, Slimes eat everything you give them.
So I poured the blood into the drainage as well.

I wait for the bathtub to fill enough before getting in.
Mmm, this feels so nice!
*Purr*… Did I just purr?
I didn't know I do that!
That'll take some time to get used to…
After I'm done bathing and changing into new clothes, there some things I need to take care of.

Firstly, what do I do when I'm not using the bath?
I think I'll just leave it as it is, and just plug the bathtub when I'm bathing.
I'll also add a tunnel to let the steam escape, at the same place where the drainage exits the cliff.
I notice some Slimes I contracted don't like staying in the drainage tunnel.
Instead, they enjoy hanging out in the bathtub.
Are they drinking the hot water?
Never mind.
I'll just leave them be.

Secondly, my clothes: I've been storing them so far, but I really need to wash them.
Can't I do that with magic?

*“Clean!”*

To my surprise, it works.
I see magic spreading through the clothes, but I've no idea how it works or what magic element was used at all…
Can I use it after taking a dump as well?
I'll try it out sometime.
Anyway, I have clean clothes now!
I put them back into my Infinite Storage.
Now, that those matters have been taken care of, I can continue with my plans.
It's not like I totally forgot what I wanted to do.
OK, I did.
I need something to note stuff.
Can I do that with my interface?
Yes, I can.
I have a memo function in my menu.
I was prepared to misuse the folders in my Infinite Storage for that!
I'm being sidetracked again.
I wanted to make a bedroom!

I move to the corner of my living room that should connect to the bedroom.
It's directly next to the chimney.
Come to think of it, if I can find more Continuous Magic Crystals of Heat, I can replace the chimney…
No, I like the looks of a chimney.
But I can add heating to the bedroom without adding another chimney!
I make a note: “Add Heating to Bedroom with Continuous Magic Crystals of Heat”.
It's time to dig.

*“Grind! Grind!”*

Like before, I grind smaller blocks until the hole reaches the size I want.
I also break an opening to the hole I put the Awakening Crystal of Light Magic.

*“Grind! Grind!”*

After I'm done, I re-erect a wall, separating the bedroom from the living room.
I also add a sliding door to my light source.
I store my bed in the living room and move it to the bedroom.
Done!
With that, I have the basic rooms I want.
For some reason, I wanted to add some storage rooms and a workshop later.
But since I have Infinite Storage, I only need to add a workshop.
I make another note: “Build Workshop”.

<h1>Visitors in the Forest</h1>
A few days later, it's about lunchtime.
I'm done with preparing lunch.

*«Raiden, lunch is ready!»*

I begin eating.
I think my cooking is improving.
I'm still missing some spices, but I can manage.
My hand-eye coordination has greatly improved as well.
Making use of my trait Nimble and Precise, I now primarily move in the forest by jumping from treetop to treetop.
After I finish my portion, Raiden is still not here.

What's going on?
Usually, it takes Raiden only a few minutes to get here.
I try to mentally connect to Raiden.
There he is.
I sense Raiden calling me over.
I feel a sense of wariness from Raiden.
I leave my cave and move to where I feel Raiden currently is.
I keep myself hidden.
I find Raiden in one of the trees.
He's unharmed!
That's a relief.
Just as I wanted to ask him about what happened, I see who Raiden is intently watching: we have visitors!
There are several people in the forest, all men, they all wear similar armour.
Most of them seem to be Humes.
There's one Ailuranthrope with them.
One of the Humes seems to be my age.
I haven't seen other people here until now.
What are they doing here?

“Who's there?” the boy shouts.
Have I been spotted?

“I think you're imagining things,” one of the men says.
The rest starts laughing.
So was it just a fluke?

*«Lunch is on the table. Go home and eat,»* I send Raiden away.

Raiden takes the skies.
The boy sees Raiden fly up and exclaims:

“There, a Hawk!”

“That was just a lucky guess!” one of the adults says.

“Maybe.
But still, I didn't think we'd get this lost in the forest…”

“That's just how Avan Forest is.”

He takes glances in my direction.

“I just probed the area…, there's nothing there,” one of the other adults says.

It looks like my Presence Isolation skill is very effective.
That being the case, I'm quite confident I can escape if something happens.
I should show myself and talk to them.
I jump down.
Upon noticing me, the men stop laughing.
They immediately put their hands at their hips, ready to draw their swords at any time.
I should have walked in from somewhere else…

“You're quite sharp!” I smile.
Let's just hope my Appealing Charisma trait helps.
“Hello there, my name is Swift. I live around here.”

The boy makes a triumphant expression.

“So I wasn't imagining it! I'm Matt. Nice to meet you.”

The men are whispering.

“What's a kid doing here alone?”

“I just probed the area…, I was sure nobody was there a moment ago.”

“But…”

“It seems he isn't a threat.”

I turn to the men.

“I can hear you…
If you dislike my presence that much, I can just leave. I don't mind…
I was just curious since nobody ever comes to this forest…”

I turn around to leave the place.

“No, wait!” the boy, I think his name was Matt, shouts.
I turn to him.
The men look like they want to protest.
But he silences them with a stare, not an angry one.
They loosen up a bit.
They're still wary of me.
But I don't have to worry about them drawing their weapons for now.
It looks like Matt is in charge, even though he's the youngest of the group.
And he wields quite the authority, too.

“We've come here in search of the Crystal Down.
But we're kinda lost here…”

“The Crystal Down?”

“Yes, it's a hill in this forest that's full of Awakening Crystals.”

That cliff had a name?

“Ah, that place!
I know where it is.
Should I lead the way?”

“Yes, please do!”

I walk ahead to lead the way to the Awakening Crystals.
Matt walks directly next to me.
The others follow behind us.

“So Matt, are you looking for a certain trait or skill?”

“Not really, I'm here because of one of my family's many traditions.
At age {% include ruby number="X"%}, we're supposed to try going to the Crystal Down and get a trait or a skill.

If we get something useful, we get extra points on the succession score.
I was told only to get something if I'm sure it's not bad for me.
If we get something detrimental, we get negative points or even disqualification.
Nobody knows what you're going to get.
So I'm just hoping I find something that's not bad for me.”

So they have a merit-based system for succession here?
That sounds better than always choosing the eldest.
Are they to choose something based on instinct?
Or is this a lucky chance thing?

“The detrimental traits those crystal give can be quite nasty.
Is it worth the risk getting these?”

“Well, it's an optional thing.
If I'm not sure about it, I should simply opt out, even at this stage.”

“I see.
Back to my question: if you could choose what you get, what would you want?”

“If possible, I'd like to receive the Light Magic skill.”

“Light Magic skill?”

“Yes, it's very hard to raise.
So having it would help quite a lot.”

“I see.”

“I'm just guessing,” Matt moves closer to me, and whispers, “but judging from your question, could it be that you can discern what effects the Awakening Crystals have?”

I nod.

“That's incredible!
Nobody has ever been able to do that!”

“And you believe me?
Just like that?
We have just met, you know.”

“Well, I have a skill that allows me to guess if something might be detrimental to me.
You seem fine.
In fact, I'm just trying to prove the skill I have is real.
I know it is.
It can't be I'm right just by chance.
The problem is: it doesn't turn up on Identifying Crystals.
So even if you were lying, it'll be my fault for trusting you, and my skill is just my imagination.
Enough about me, I can't say I expected to meet someone else in this forest…”

“Why? It is comparatively safe here.”

“These woods are very special.
People that get in here this deep usually get lost, just like our group.”

We arrive near the cliff.

“We're here,” I point uphill, “the crystals are just up there.”

“That was faster than expected.”

“You think so?”

“Yes, we've been wandering around for bells before you arrived.
And you brought us here in not even half a bell!
How don't you get lost?”

“I can't say, I just don't get lost…
Anyway, let's look for your Awakening Crystal of Light Magic!”

I lead the group up onto the hill.
While doing that, I try looking for an Awakening Crystal of Light Magic.
Surprisingly, I find one quite fast.
When we arrive near it, I point to the white crystal and whisper: “I believe this is the one you are looking for.”

Matt looks at me, then at the crystal.
Without hesitation, he grabs it.
It begins shining brightly.
After the light dies down, the crystal has turned translucent as it happened with me before.

One of the men touches Matt with an orb.
After looking at the orb for a while he says: “You seem to have gained Light Magic Level 4.
Congratulations, though that doesn't prove that other skill of yours exists.”

“I know, thanks.”

Since they're done with their objective.
They decide to leave right away.
I lead them to the river nearby and see them off.

“If you follow this river, you should get out of this forest quite fast.”

“Thanks for your help, Swift.”

“Don't mention it, I was just bored, anyway.
It's not every day that I meet people in this forest.”

I leave and hide in the trees.
It seems I'm not being followed.
The group is still in viewing distance.
Let's analyze the boy.
Does it even work on him?

{% include character/window.md character="matthew-1-15" %}

So the first person my age I meet turns out to be a prince.
The second prince, no less.
I guess merit-based successions make even more sense in a royal family!…
That means this place is run by a monarchy.
But he doesn't seem to care much about this position.
He has a Hidden Trait, Super Intuition.
Doesn't that mean those crystals don't pick up Hidden Traits?
That would explain quite a lot!
Also, that would be quite convenient for me…
I make a note: check myself it an Identifying Crystal.
Well, I don't think I'll meet him again.
And if I do, I'll just ignore the fact he's royalty.
After all, he didn't seem to mind.

<h1>On the Way Home from the Forest</h1>
We've just left the forest and are on our way home.
Sain looks like he has a question on his mind.

“What's up Sain?
You seem troubled.”

“Nothing…”

“Don't be reserved…”

“Then, I'll just say it.
Young Master, do you think that Ailuranthrope boy we've just met is the keeper of the Crystal Down?”

That boy being the keeper?
No, I don't think so!
Though he is intriguing.

“Why do you think so?”

“Well, he led us through that forest with ease.
And he asked you what skill you want and the one crystal he showed you happened to contain that skill.
I don't think that's a coincidence.”

“That's true.
But unlike what I expect from a keeper.
He didn't seem to have any interest in measuring my worth.
He had more the vibe of a curious cat.”

That's true.
He seemed to me more like a curious cat.
I was short of inviting him to the castle when he left…
But I didn't get the chance to do so.
Seth interjects:

“Though I can agree he looked like a curious cat, I believe you just can't read the intentions of the keeper even with the skill you supposedly have.
I'll report to your father you received the blessings of the keeper.”

Wait, what?

“We're not even sure he's the keeper!”

“We have to assume he is.
He appeared out of nowhere even though we were sure there can't be anyone.
Even when we about to attack him he was just calmly standing there as if we were no threat to him at all.

You told him your reason why you want the skill.
And since you got the exact skill you wanted, it means the keeper agrees with you, meaning you might actually have that skill you claim you have.”

Seth is right, and I'm happy to receive some confirmation that my skill is real.
But still… it feels like a lie to me…

“Do what you think is right.
I'm not convinced he is the keeper.
Anyway, keeper or not keeper, I want to give him something for his help.
Do you have any ideas?”

“Giving him a cloak with your personal crest would be most appropriate.”

“That's way too formal…
I don't think a reclusive person like him would appreciate that.”

This time Silas voiced his opinion:

“Young Master, if you want to be more practical, I think arrows would make a good gift.”

Arrows?
Why would he need arrows?

“What makes you say that?” Sain asks.
Looks like I'm not the only one that's surprised by that suggestion.

“He had a quiver of arrows with him.
The arrows were quite worn out.
They were well-used.
My guess is they are at their limit.
Even if he doesn't need them by the time you give them to him, he'll still find them useful sometime in the future.”

As always, Silas is quite perceptive.
I didn't even notice he had a quiver with him at all!

“Great, can both of those be prepared by the time for the next outing?”

“Yes, we'll have it taken care of.”

“Thanks, I appreciate it.”

<h1>Bunnyflies Faryl, Felix and Flynn</h1>
The next day, I'm out exploring the forest.
Lucky me, I find some carrots… or are those beets?
At first glance, they look like carrots but their colour is red as beets…
I should analyze them.
It'd be bad if they turn out to be poisonous.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Barrot
&gt;
&gt; This plant prefers shades.
&gt; It grows almost everywhere where there's enough water.
&gt; This plant is rarely used in cooking. This plant grows very fast.
&gt;

So they're edible.
I pull one from the ground — it's a red carrot — and break off a bit to taste it.
Carrots or beets, what will it taste like?
I take a bite.
Sigh, it's neither… it tastes like ginger.
Well, at least I got something to add to my spice collection.
So far, I've found more spices than anything.
It's not bad since I can experiment more with those.
But I'd like to have some real vegetables soon…
There are only so many ways to cook meat without vegetables…
I harvest some roots before I continue exploring.

Or at least that's what I wanted to do.
I come to a very peculiar scene: rabbits are flying in the air.
The rabbits have short antlers and butterfly wings.
I analyze them.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Bunnyflies
&gt;
&gt; Bunnyflies is one of the most elusive species in existence.
&gt; They are said to have high compatibility with Light and Forest Magic.
&gt;

So far it doesn't look like they've noticed me.
No, they must have noticed me — they're flying directly towards me.
They fly around me.
They seem to be interested in my hands.
But as they see my hands are empty, they don't get closer.
Wait… I take out a Barrot from my Infinite Storage.
The Bunnyflies close in and eat the greens.
Do they only eat the greens?
I break off the greens and put them on the ground before me.
I also take out the other Barrots and break off the greens to feed them.

They're such a soothing sight.
I should try to tame them.
As before, I imagine my energy gently touching and enveloping them.

*“Taming Monster!”*

Fine strings of light of all colours appear from my hand and circle around the Bunnyflies.
The strings of light form balls around them.
The balls are immediately absorbed by the Bunnyflies.
Success!
This is even faster than the previous time!

{:.interface}
&gt; Familiar Contract
&gt;
&gt; The contracts with the wild Bunnyflies has been successfully made.\\
&gt; Give the Bunnyflies names: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
&gt; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\
&gt; <span class="btn btn-outline-primary active">OK</span> <span class="btn btn-outline-primary">Cancel</span>
&gt;

Oh, I need names…
I name the blue-winged one Faryl, the green-winged one Felix and the red-winged one Flynn.

“I hope we get along, Faryl, Felix and Flynn.”

*«Master, please give us lots of tasty greens.»*

I hear a squeaky voice in my head.
Did that just come from the Bunnyflies?
I try to communicate mentally with them.

*«Can you hear me?»*

*«Yes, we can hear you, master.»*

*«I see. Let's go to my place first. I'll feed you greens regularly.»*

I go back to my cave.
Watching them, they seem quite clingy.
I think I should make them a place to sleep in my bedroom.
Until now, I only had Raiden, and he lives on his own in the forest, only coming to my cave to eat from time to time.
But if I make a sleeping place for the Bunnyflies, I should make one for Raiden as well.

I make shelves from stone.
Three on side of the room and one on the other.
I point to the three shelves.
*«You can sleep there. Do you need something to make you comfortable?»*

*«No, we're fine.
We can use Forest Magic to create our nests.»*

They start growing plants on their shelves as they said that.
I call Raiden over to introduce them to each other.

*«Raiden, I have contracted some Bunnyflies.
Come here and introduce yourself.
And don't eat them!
Also, I prepared some space for you if want to stay in my cave.»*

*«Yes, I won't eat them. But I'm fine with living outside.»*

Oh? I can hear Raiden as well.
His voice sounds quite deep.
Did I gain a skill?
I check my Character Window.

{% include character/window.md character="swift-1-17" %}

It looks like I've gained Telepathy Level 3.
I have gained Forest Magic too.
I try communicating with my Slimes, but they don't answer.
Instead, I can only feel emotions coming from them.
But I could already do that before… I wonder what the trigger for getting the skill was.
Maybe contracting the Bunnyflies was the trigger.
Those Bunnyflies they remind me of Wolpertinger…
I remember hearing of them when I was a child.
Don't they like alcohol?
Maybe I should try making some.

I squash some Tarry and put them into a jar and close it.
If I'm lucky, I should have some yeast to use soon. And I go tap trees for gathering maple sap.
I hang some glass containers to the maple trees and cut a hole in the tree.
To stop the hole from closing, I create a cylinder of glass in the hole.

Raiden arrives, and I introduce my familiars to each other.
I thought the Bunnyflies would be afraid of Raiden, but it turns out they see him more like a protective elder brother.

Two days later, I have a look at the jar.
I open the jar to ventilate it.
And it smells like yeast.
That was way faster than I expected!
Usually, that takes about two weeks.
Anyway, I have my yeast.
I put the jar into my Infinite Storage to stop time. If I've known the yeast would be done in two days, I'd started gathering maple sap much earlier!

After another two days, I get the containers full of maple sap and cook them concentrate the sugar content.
After cooking down the contents of eight containers down to two pots.
I let the syrup cool down a little.
As it's reaching room temperature, I add in the yeast from the jar I stored away.
I close the pots and leave them in a corner of my kitchen.

Lately, I have the feeling I'm not tired at all until past midnight.
In the last few days, I can't even sleep before {% include ruby base="1X:00" text="twenty-three bells" %}!
I guess this is another effect of this body…

After a week, I open one of the pots to inspect.
Yes, that smells like maple wine.
I quickly fill the wine into bottles and put them into my Infinite Storage.
But I was too slow.
The Bunnyflies have already caught the scent.
They've already come to the kitchen.
They circle me.

*«Master, master! That smells great! Can we have some? Please? Pretty please?!»*

I give up. They're just way too cute!

“Just one bowl.
This stuff takes a while to make.”

I pour them one bowl of wine to drink.

*«Yay!»* They land and drink. «It's delicious!»* They really like it!
Raiden arrives as well.

*«Do you want some as well, Raiden?»*

*«No, I'm fine.»*

I'm glad it worked.
I'm done with the first pot and open the second one. It smells of vinegar.
It seems like this pot failed.
It's not a big deal since I already got some wine. Plus, I could use some vinegar for my cooking.
I fill the vinegar into bottles as well.

As I'm done filling the bottles, the Bunnyflies have finished their bowl of wine.
They're not alone.
One of the Slimes that prefers living in the bathtub has joined them.

*«Master, more please! Pretty please!»*

I have to stay strong.

“No, just that single bowl. If you bother me more, I will never make it again.”

*«Oh…»*

Dejected, they fly to the living room to play.
The slime reluctantly follows them.
I have to stay strong…

<h1>Again, Visitors in the Forest</h1>
A few days later, I'm on one of my hunts.
I'm sitting hidden in the bushes.
A horde of boars is about to pass by.
I knock an arrow, preparing to shoot.
The boars pass by; I shoot. And miss.
While I have missed shots before, I've never missed that much!
I try shooting more arrows with the same result.

Something is off… Out of other options, I make one of the boars fall into a pitfall.
I then get my short sword and pierce it.
Yuck, I hate that sensation... but I have to eat.
And I don't see myself becoming a vegetarian.
I need to get used to that… I put the dead boar into my Infinite Storage.

*«Master, we have visitors.»*

I hear Raiden's voice in my head.

*«Visitors?»*

*«It's the same group as before! They seem to be calling you.»*

The same group as before? Who?
Oh, I remember! The group of the second prince.
He's back?
I move to where Raiden is.
I see the group.
Yes, it's the same group as last time.
I have Raiden sit on my shoulder as I jump down.

“Hey! It's been a while, Matt.”

“Swift! I'm glad to find you.
I wanted to drop by to thank you for your help last time.”

Help? Oh, yeah, I did help him a lot last time.
Maybe he can help me with my hunting problem.

“There's no need for that, I was just killing time.
At least that's what I want to say.
I do have a problem I need solving.”

Matt's face turns bright.

“Just say it, maybe I can help!”

“I was just hunting…
For some reason, I can't seem to hit anything today.”

“Wait, you were hunting with these arrows?” the Ailuranthrope that's accompanying Matt interjects, “sorry to interrupt. But I couldn't help myself.”

“It's no problem,” Matt answers, “come to think of it, I haven't introduced the others to you.
The one just now is Silas.
The others are Sain and Seth.”

They each nod respectively when Matt mentions their name.

“You might already know it, but still: I'm Swift.
Pleased to meet you,” I turn to Silas, “what's wrong with my arrows?”

“What…” Silas takes a deep breath, “those arrows are completely worn out, you need new ones!”

“New arrows…” I mutter to myself, “that could be a problem…”

The men start laughing.
Seeing me being confused, Seth explains.

“With you being the Keeper of the Crystal Down, we weren't sure how to treat you.
But you seem more and more like a very specialized person.”

“I am not a special person, I think.
Specialized maybe.
I do have the title Keeper of Crystal Down, but that doesn't change much…
I still breathe and eat.
Since you're here, should I take you to my place?
We can continue talking there.”

I lead them to my cave.
I push the ivy aside to reveal the entrance.
The Bunnyflies come out.
They circle around me.

“I know you guys want to play,” I speak instead of using telepathy so the others can hear, “but we have guests right now.
So you guys have to wait.”

My guests open their eyes wide.

“What's up?”

“Please, tell me if I'm dreaming, but are those Bunnyflies?”

“Those three? Yes, those are Bunnyflies I contracted.
As you can see, they are very playful.”

“You contracted them?!
Wait, I thought that Hawk on your shoulder is just an unusual hawk, but could it be that's a Thunder Hawk?”

I nod.

“Just after we establish you being a normal person, there's one surprise after another with you…”

“I just happened to come across them and the taming spell happened to work.
Anyway, please come in!”

“So you do live here by yourself.”

Are they trying to get me to move?
But I'm not done with this place…

“I have Raiden and others with me.”

“Even so I can't simply see a young boy like you live here without contact with other people and say nothing.”

“I can manage.
Besides, I don't know anyone outside I can rely on… I'll be right back.”

That's the truth.
I go to the kitchen and hang the boar I hunted and let out the blood.
After that, I come back to the living room.
Sain looks like he has a bright idea.

“Can I use this on you?” he asks.
He takes out his Identifying Crystal.
I'm quite sure my Hidden Traits won't show up.
I wanted to know what it shows, anyway.and they seem trustworthy enough to me.
In the worst case, I'm still positive I can get away fast enough.

“Please do, I'm interested in what it shows about me.”

Sain touches me with the crystal. He looks at it.

“What the…?!”

“What's the matter, Sain?” Seth walks behind Sain and has a look as well. He falls silent.

“You… you have an impressive collection of titles.”

I get the feeling they're hiding something.

“I mean really, what's the matter? You are hiding something.”

Sain bows and apologizes: “I shouldn't have pried.
Mixed Ailuranthropes usually aren't welcome in both of their parents' communities.
You must have been alone for quite a while…
Even your Survival Skills are top notch!
I guess I have to give up on convincing you…”

“I don't mind.”

Doesn't that mean people won't ask me much about my parents?
That's great!
Oh yeah, I wanted to know what traits that crystal shows.

“So… what traits do I have according to the crystal?”

“Let me see… Mystic Eye of Analysis, Mystic Eye of Knowledge, Infinite Storage, Accelerated
Recovery, Quick Learner, Appealing Charisma and Nimble &amp; Precise.
That's quite a good set of traits.”

I didn't expect my Mystic Eyes to be visible, but that's not a problem — people would notice due to my heterochromia, anyway.

“I see.”

We interrupt our conversation.
The Bunnyflies seem to be quite interested in something Matt has with him.

“I thought Bunnyflies were shy. But these look very clingy.”

“They are clingy.”

*«We smell tasty water! We want tasty water!»*

“I'm afraid they're even more clingy when they smell alcohol.
I think they smell some on you, Matt.”

“This?” Matt takes out a bottle from his pack, “this is some ale I bought on the way here.
Can I give it to them?”

“Sure, let me get a bowl.”

Matt pours some ale into the bowl I bring.
The Bunnyflies start drinking.
One slime crawls over to join them. I help it up.

“Please don't mind this slime.
It likes alcohol as well.
They are a soothing sight, aren't they?”

Everyone nods.

“Before I forget, I want to give you some things as thanks for your help last time.”

Matt starts lining of the gifts: two quivers full of arrows and a cloak.
I take the cloak and try it on.

“It suits you.”

“Thanks. I just wonder what this crest is.”

“That's my personal crest.”

“Personal Crest?” Oh, yes, I remember, he is the second prince.
Let's just feign ignorance.

“Let me properly introduce myself.
I'm Matthew Sitnalta, the second prince of Sitnalta.”

“I see.”

“You don't seem surprised.”

“Should I be?
I found out as you were leaving last time.
You seemed to be tired of formalities, so I just ignored it.”

Matt grins.

“I like you, I really want to invite you to live in the castle with me.
You'd shake up things quite a bit.”

Now, it's come to this I can't really decline. What to do now…

“But you seem set on staying here, so I won't ask.”

“Thanks for your consideration.”

That's great.
When I think about it, I imagine living in the castle might become a hassle, I'm not very keen on being subjected to intrigues and the likes.

“But expect me to drop by once in a while.”

“Sure. You're welcome anytime.”

“Young Master, we need to get back soon.”

“Already? We barely sat down!” Matt has a look of disappointment.

“You need to be back by dusk.
Next time, plan more time for this.”

“I'll try to prepare a place to sleep for you guys by then.
Though you might want to bring some beddings.”

“Please do!” Matt's mood instantly improves.

“While you're at it, I could use some flour.
I haven't been able to produce that in the forest.
And I'm starting to miss bread…”

I still have some Lottery Boxes of Food I haven't touched since I have started hunting.
Maybe… No, I'll have to restrain myself!
I want to savour those later.

“Flour, I can take care of that!”

I lead the group to the river again.
I'm surprised to see the Bunnyflies following us.

“It's been way too short, but it was nice seeing you again.”

“I feel the same. Till next time!
I won't be going anywhere in the foreseeable future.
So drop by whenever you feel like it.”

As Matt's group was leaving, I hear Flynn crying.

*«I want to stay with friend!»*

*«Don't cry. He'll come back to visit soon.»*

*«But I want to be with friend!!»*

I sigh… *«Even if it means leaving Faryl, Felix and me?»*

*«I want to be with friend!!»*

*«Master, please let Flynn go.»*

*«Even the two of you…, wait, you don't want to go?»*

*«No, our place is with master. But Flynn's place is with friend.»*

*«I get it. Come, let's go after them.»*

I chase after Matt's group.
When I reach them they seem surprised I chased them.

“What is the matter, Swift?
Did you change your mind?
Do you want to come to the castle with us?”

“No, I don't. But Flynn wants to stay with you. Is that OK?”

“Sure, I don't mind. Do I need to hide him? And what do Bunnyflies eat?”

“Do what you think is best. They eat vegetables.”

“I see.”

“I'll transfer the contract then. *Transfer Contract!* There. Please take care of Flynn.”

“I will.”

“This time, really, till next time. See you!”

“See you!”

I move towards my cave.

Arriving at my cave, I drop into my chair.
I didn't expect to meet them again…
I pour some maple wine into a bowl.
I wonder why Flynn insisted on leaving…
I decide to ask the other two about it.

*«Faryl, Felix, why did Flynn want to go with Matt?»*

*«Flynn is destined to be with friend.»*

*«What about you?»*

*«We are destined to be with master.»*

It doesn't make any sense to me. I don't understand what they mean.

*«Destined?»*

*«Destined master shines most beautiful to us.»*

Is that a unique quality of each individual?
Or is it just a certain skill or trait?
I wished I could learn more.
I don't think asking the Bunnyflies will give me more information.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Worrying About the Future</h1>
Swift was just here a moment ago, but I can't tell where he went.
It's as if he just vanished into thin air — like an illusion.
The only proof he was here is I have a Bunnyfly with me.
Flynn seems to want to stay with me, so Swift transferred his contract to me.
He's flying around me.

“I didn't know familiar contracts can be transferred.”

“It's said you need to master Familiar Magic to able to do that…”

“If I remember correctly, he has mastered all magics,” Silas adds.

Silence… It's true Swift has mastered a lot of skills.
Him having a good set of traits probably helped in that regard.

“We should try to win him for our country. He'd be quite an asset,” Seth suggests.

“No, don't. He might leave for another country if we do that.
He wasn't exactly excited about me inviting him to the castle.
I want to have friendly relations with him.
It'd be more than enough if he stays neutral if anything happens.”

“If you say so.
But what do we say to your father?”

“There's no need for worrying.
As you've said before: he's the keeper of the Crystal Down.
The keeper is not to be drawn into political struggles.
Father will understand, but I fear the other nobles might make a fuss in the future nonetheless…”

“You gave him the coat with your crest, that should deter the nobles from messing with him.”

“I agree. But I have this feeling something might happen…”

*«Don't worry!»*

I hear a squeaky voice. I turn to the others.

“Did you guys say something?”

The men shake their heads. Flynn flies directly in front of me.

*«Don't worry! Former master is strong.»*

“Is that your voice, Flynn?”

*«Master can talk with me like this. Former master can, too. Big Bro Raiden as well.»*

“What's the matter?”

“It seems I can communicate with Flynn.
He tells me to worry.
Apparently, Swift can communicate with the Bunnyflies as well.”

I try asking Flynn several questions.
The answers aren't that useful.
But now I get what Swift meant by playful.

When we arrive at the castle, I meet with my father, “father, I'm back!”

“Matt, you're back. How was the meeting with the Keeper?”

Someone knocks on the door.

“I hear my little brother has returned from his trip.”

“Elder brother!”

My elder brother Virgil enters.

“Matt, how was your trip?”

“Way too short, but I was just about to tell father about it.”

“If I remember correctly, you were on the way to Avan Forest. Did you get your skill?”

“Yes, but I got it a week ago, on my previous trip. I was just visiting the keeper this time.”

“So how did that go?”

“It went well.
As expected, he's not fond of politics.
But he seems friendly.
One of the Bunnyflies he has around decided to come with me.
Come, Flynn, say hello.”

Flynn flies about.

“I've never thought I'd get to see a Bunnyfly in person.
And he's following you?”

“The familiar contract was transferred to me.
But about the keeper.
Flynn tells me the Keeper might leave the country if he gets drawn into struggles.”

“I understand.
I'll talk to the nobles of both all factions to mind that.
But you act as he'll eventually leave the forest.”

“I have a feeling he will.
He's just more interested in staying in the forest right now.
Maybe by the time I have come of age…”

“Is it that skill you claim to have?
I still find it hard to believe you have that.
But we'll see in time if it's true…”

<h1>Slimes and Slime Gelatine</h1>
Before I return to my cave, I drop by the drainage to inspect the area.
It doesn't smell at all — that's great.
That means the Slimes do a good job of cleaning up.
The Slimes come out to greet me.

I notice some of the Slimes have a different colour.
They are blood red. I analyze them.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Blood Slime
&gt;
&gt; This evolved slime enjoys eating blood.
&gt;

Blood Slimes?
That means I can just keep them in the kitchen and feed them the blood directly!
I take them with me to the cave.
When I enter the cave, I notice some strange blob on the kitchen table.
I let the Blood Slimes eat their fill of blood while I analyze the blob on the table.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Slime Gelatine
&gt;
&gt; While Slimes can sustain themselves just by drinking water, some Slimes like to eat.
&gt; Depending on what they eat might produce several items.
&gt; One of these products is Slime Gelatine.
&gt; The jelly is edible, even though it doesn't have any taste or nutritional value.
&gt;

Slime Gelatine? It's gelatine!
I can make fruit jelly! With this… and gummy bears!
But I need more than this.
What do I need to feed the Slimes to get more jelly?! As if to answer my question one of the Slimes crawls on the table and eats part of the animal fat I set aside and forgot to put away.

“So you Slimes make jelly from animal fat?” I ask the Slime.
Not that it would answer me.
It just simply continues to happily eat the fat.

Excited, I put more animal fat on the table.
I do have quite the amount in my Infinite Storage.
I call the Slimes that live in the cave.

*«If you like Animal Fat, you guys can have it.»*

Some Slimes come to the kitchen to enjoy the fat.
While those eat, I decide to check the Slimes that enjoy the bathtub.
They've become translucent with very fluid liquid inside them.
So those have evolved as well?

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Hot Springs Slime
&gt;
&gt; This evolved slime enjoys bathing in hot water.
&gt; It also enjoys drinking and soaking in said water.
&gt;

I feel like I should have given the Slimes more attention…
My guess is Slimes evolve depending on their diet.
I wonder what kinds of Slimes and other Slime products I can get…
Let's add it to the bucket list.
The next day,
I have more than enough gelatine.
Let's try making gummy bears.
Why gummy bears?
I like wine gums, but I should start simple with just gummy bears.
I mush Tarries and sieve them.
Then I boil the juice to thicken it.
After I lost about 30% of the water I let the juice cool down a just a little.
While it's still hot but not boiling, I put in some Jelly blobs.
I stir the mixture until it's homogenous and pour it into bear-shaped ice cube trays I made from glass.
I then let it cool down completely.

I need to make some kind of fridge.
Not to store stuff, I can use my Infinite Storage for that.
I need it for cooling things!
I take another note in my memos: “build a fridge”.

Later, I check the results.
The bad news is it doesn't have the consistency of gummy bears.
The good news is it ended up becoming fruit jelly, so it's not a complete failure.
I guess to get gummy bear consistency, I need to boil the juice down even more.
Let's put it into my Infinite Storage for now.

<h1>Meeting the Gods of Cratherion</h1>
I find myself in a bright white room.
How did I get here?
As far as I know, I just went to bed just like any other day…

“Hello, Swift!”

I heard a voice behind me.
I turn around and see three people: an Ailuranthrope man, a Hume man, and a Hume girl.
Though she could also be a Neotes…

The Ailuranthrope is slightly taller than the Hume.
He was grey hair and is wearing a white toga without stripes.
The girl has brown hair and wears a toga with brown stripes.
Unlike the other two, the Hume doesn't wear a toga.
Instead, he wears normal clothes in dark green.
And his hair is green?

“The three of you seem to know me.
Who are you?
And where is this place?”

“Let's start simple,” the Hume answers, “we are gods of Cratherion and this is the Divine Realm.”

“Gods? Divine Realm? Have I died again? But…”

“No, we just called your soul here for a talk.
Your body still safe and sound in your bed.”

“Yes, a talk.
It seems the god responsible for reincarnating you did not do his job properly…
So we're doing this talk instead.
We are our manners!
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Suscellu, the deity of Nature and Wine.
The Ailuranthrope here is Glanuh, the deity of Vision and the patron deity of Ailuranthropes.
And this Neotes girl is…”

“Clayah, the deity of Shelter and Perseverance and the patron deity of Neotes.”

So they are gods of Cratherion.
I wonder what they want…

“Let's get straight to the topic: you are way too skilled.”

Clayah begins the talks.

So it's about my skills.
Looks like I need to lose some...

“So do I need to surrender some skills?”

“No, that's not it.
You can earn all of these, anyway.
The real problem is: you have too many traits.
To remove those traits, we need to kill you.”

Shocked by that I drop to the ground.
I don't want to die!
I haven't properly enjoyed life so far.
I start breaking into tears…
I didn't fall into despair when I was about to be hit by a bus! Why now?
Suddenly, I remember the people I left behind…
I can never see them again.
And now I'm about to die again… I full-on start crying.

“Clayah, you just had to bully him…
Oh, I see.
It's finally sinking in that he died in the other world.”

Glanuh pets me on the head.

“Killing you would be the last resort.
We don't need to do that.
For now, just keep on crying your heart out.
The family of your previous life is important after all.”

After what feels like hours, I finally stop crying.
I feel better after all that crying.
Glanuh continues the discussion.

“Have you calmed down?
We've decided you give you a task that's of equivalent value to the excess traits you gained.”

“A task?”

“Yes, but as far as you can see you're already doing it.”

“All I'm doing it keeping to myself in the forest and building and cooking…
Do you want me to stay by myself for the rest of my life?!”

I've been making a place in the forest for fun, but I did want to leave that place at some point!
So my prison is going to be that forest?

“No, no, no, this whole situation is not your fault to begin with.
So punishing you would be unfair.
You must have noticed you've become the keeper of the Crystal Down.
We simply want you to take that position for real.
That means you are to stay neutral in any political conflicts that humans might have.
Aside from that, you can go wherever you like and do whatever you like.”

“What if I'm getting dragged into something? Or if I'm being targeted?”

“We'll send you a message to warn you if you might get tangled in some intrigue.
The people of Cratherion should acknowledge your position and accept your neutrality.
We'll only send you messages if it's about political neutrality.
Usually, exceptions may apply.

If people target you despite that, you do have the right to defend yourself.
If all goes wrong you can simply retreat to any forest, preferably Avan Forest.
The forest will protect you.”

“I don't see any reason to decline.
I don't like getting involved in politics, anyway.
Plus, the alternative isn't that alluring…”

The two deities give Clayah a look.

“That was just supposed to be an explanation!
As the patron of Neotes, I'm supposed to protect you!
Not to kill you!”

“I see. Anyway, I accept.
Not getting involved in politics works out for me.”

This is too tiring! Exhausted, I lie down. It looks like I get to live a normal life!

“That's great! We'll be giving you a trait to prove you're accepted by us to be the keeper.”

“Another trait? Weren't you just concerned with me having too many?”

I sit up and look at the deities.
They look more relaxed now.
As if they've stopped caring…

“You've accepted our terms: there's no need to worry about you having too many traits anymore.
Besides, the trait you receive from us is the Oracle trait.
It proofs you receive messages from the gods.
In your case, it's just for show since you can receive more detailed messages by mail.
It should serve to deter people from getting you involved in possible intrigues.”

“It's this way too much to my favour?”

“That just shows how much your political neutrality means to us. Don't worry about it.”

“Since the main talk is done. Let's enjoy ourselves!”

The three sit down near me.
Suscellu takes out golden cups from nowhere and pours in something for everyone present, including me.
I smell honey and alcohol.
I'm excited to taste it.

“Is that mead?”

“Yes, it is. Come to think of it, you were quite fond of mead in your previous life, weren't you?”

“I still am. But how do you know that?”

“We are gods, after all. Cheers!”

“Cheers!”

I take my cup and drink.
This is a very excellent mead!
I take out the fruit jelly.
I made several days ago from by Infinite Storage to share with them.

“I hope you're OK with this.”

They all eat.
Clayah especially seems to have taken a liking to it.

“Oh, this is tasty. What is it called?”

“It's called fruit jelly.”

“Jelly? I think that's the first time someone made something edible from Slime Gelatine.”

“You can just process connective tissue in animals to gelatine as well.
It's just way easier to use Slime Gelatine.”

“I wonder what other tasty treats you can make if you have the ingredients…”

“If I have the ingredients?
I need to get used to the ingredients here first.
Though I do wish I could have some proper vegetables and grain.
I just keep finding spices.”

“I'm looking forward to what you make in the future.
Be sure to drop by from time to time and give us a taste.”

“Drop by? Isn't this the Divine Realm? How I can get here?”

“Oh, yeah, you're mortal, I almost forgot.
Then how about we meet once every few moons?
We'll just pull your soul here.
Of course, we'll send you the exact time in a message beforehand.”

“If you're doing that, get Rhygni involved as well,” Suscellu retorts, “it would become quite a problem if you don't invite the Deity of Cooking for those occasions.”

“I know, I'll do that.”

“I'll do my best to prepare something by then!”

“I know it's kinda too late to ask, but I'm underage, aren't I? Is it OK to drink?”

“There's no law in Cratherion that prohibits that.
Just drink responsibly.
Alcohol needs to be enjoyed! Not wasted on drowning sorrows!”

“That being said, it's about time to return you to your body.
I'm looking forward to our next meeting.”

“I see. Till our next meeting!”

The next moment, my consciousness fades away.

<h1>Giant Rabbit Subjugation</h1>
“Damn it… Mittens! Wake up!”

“Just 5 more minutes…”

I turn around… Wait, someone is trying to wake me up?
But I'm living alone in this cave!
I shoot up and open my eyes.
Matthew is standing there.
Oh, it's just him…

“Good morning, Swift!”

“*Yawn*, good morning, Matt!”

I stretch.

“You're a surprisingly fast sleeper.”

“I'm not exactly an early riser.”

“So I noticed.”

“I'm surprised you made it here.
You couldn't do that before.
What changed?”

“Flynn offered to guide us. We just followed him.”

“I see.”

Flynn… So you need Forest Magic to navigate this forest?
But didn't have it until I reached the top of the Crystal Down!
Or do you simply need a connection to this place?

“We arrived here a bell ago, but you just didn't want to wake up.
I've been trying to wake you for the last {% include ruby base="10" text="dozen" %} minutes.
I was about to get a bucket of cold water.”

“I can do without, thanks.”

Matt laughs and leaves my room.
I look at my interface.
The clock says it's 0E:00.
I get up, get dressed — I do sleep in just underwear — and move to the living room.
Silas, Sain and Seth are waiting there.
Faryl, Felix and Flynn are flying about and playing.

“Good morning, Swift.”

“Good morning! So… How long are you staying this time?”

“We're staying until the day after tomorrow.
Also, we brought you some flour.
And we have some Poto, too! And eggs.”

Silas hands me two bags.
I have a look at them.
There are potatoes, I guess potato is called Poto here.
Surprising, in those otherworld novels, people usually don't know about potatoes.

“Thanks a lot!
I'll make something tasty from this, though we need to get some stuff first.
I'm fresh out of ingredients.”

I put the bags into my Infinite Storage.

“I guess you mean things you can get in the forest? Let's move then.”

“Let's go hunting first.
After that, we go gather some fruits.”

“I don't see Raiden anywhere.
Did something happen?” Seth asks.

“No, no, Raiden lives in the forest.
He comes when I call him.”

As if I've called him, he comes flying in.
He lands on the table.

“I would like to have him land on my arm, but it doesn't work out so well.
His claws dig in too much.”

“You should get a falconry glove then,” Matt says.

“A falconry glove? I need to go to the city for that, don't I?”

“Oh, yeah… you're a hermit.”

“No, no, the gods told me, I can leave the forest any time I want.
I just need to be politically neutral.
For now, I just enjoy living here on my own.”

“The gods?”

“Yes, I just received an oracle this night.”

“An oracle? Is something about to happen?”

For some reason, they are quite riled up.

“No, it was just the formal appointment to be the Keeper of the Crystal Down.
And the long explanation of what kinds of duties and privileges that entails.
In my case, the most important thing is staying politically neutral.
Retreating to the forest is just a means to help me with that.”

“I see… So you *can* leave the forest…”

“Yes, I can.
You seemed quite shocked about the oracle part.
Is that something unusual?”

“I don't know.
Usually, we only hear about oracles when something big is about to happen.
I wouldn't know if mediums receive a formal appointment from the gods,” Matt explains.

“Well, it might just be an exception.
The position is the Keeper of the Crystal Down after all,” Seth says.

“I guess you're right, Seth.”

“Anyway, it's about time we left for the hunt.
Raiden, where are we hunting today?”

“Err? You're leaving that to Raiden?”

“Why not? It worked out great so far.”

Raiden flies out of the cave and comes directly back.

*«There's trouble in the forest.»*

“Trouble in the forest?” I repeat so the others can hear.

*«It's quite an evil presence.»*

At that moment, I hear the ringing of a new mail.
I try to open it discreetly.

{:.interface}
&gt; Mail\\
&gt; Sender: Suscellu\\
&gt; Subject: Dangerous Monster in the Forest — Subjugation Request
&gt;
&gt; Good morning, Swift!
&gt; A Giant Rabbit in the Avan Forest has just come to my attention.
&gt; Would you and your friends kindly dispose of it?
&gt; You were going for a hunt, anyway, were you not?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,\\
&gt; Suscellu
&gt;

“Suscellu sent a message.
There's a rabbit in the forest he wants us to hunt.”

“A Giant Rabbit?”

“Yes, a Giant Rabbit.”

“If it's only that, I'm sure we can take care of it.”

“I'm surprised you're not that surprised about the rabbit.”

“Well, Giant Rabbits aren't that dangerous.
It's just they can decimate fields and forests for years if it's not hunted quickly.
So it makes sense for it to be hunted as fast as possible.”

“I see, Raiden, lead the way.”

We follow Raiden to the eastern parts of the forest.
I speak what's on my mind.

“I wonder why Suscellu told me to bring you with me…”

“Have you ever hunted a monster?” Seth asks.

“No, I haven't. Is that a problem?”

“No, not really.
This should be the first Monster Hunt for Young Master as well.
So how do you usually hunt?” Seth asks.

“I make pitfalls with my Earth Magic and shoot them with arrows.”

“That could be a problem with the Giant Rabbit.
Giant Rabbits can dig through any ground with ease.
Try using Lightning Magic instead.
Fire Magic should me effective as well, but we're in a forest.”

Lightning Magic… let's just tell them.

“I may have high levels in all magic, but I haven't actually used Lightning Magic before.”

“So you've been born with innate skill in magic?”

“Yeah…” I need to stay with that origin story!
It's not like I can just tell them I'm from another world!

“I'm sure you can manage.
Just be careful not to zap any of us.”

“I'll try my best.”

The Giant Rabbit slowly comes into view.
It's big; I think it about twice my height.
At least it's not white and throwing snowballs.
It's calmly eating, a lot.

“So what's the plan?”

“Young Master draws its attention.
You stun it with magic.
After that, you flip it on its back and kill it by stabbing it in the belly.
If anything goes wrong, we'll jump in and assist you.”

“O… OK!” Matt answers. I can hear the tension in his voice.

“Don't worry, you can do it,” Seth says.

Matt moves around so the rabbit is between us.
I can hear him mumbling something, but I can't make out what it is.

“Hey, you damn rodent! You're for dinner today!”

For some reason, the rabbit reacts and charges towards Matt, roaring.
I guess it's a Provoking Skill.
It bounces off Matt's shield.

I try to think about a Lighting Spell.
Chain Lightning?
No, my feeling tells me it would hit Matt as well.
I could enchant my weapons!
Or I could channel lighting through the blades.
Let's try and see what's better.
I draw my short blades and close in.
I imagine my blades emitting electricity from their tip.

*“Enchant Lightning!”*

I jump and ram my blades into its neck.
I retreat several steps.
My blades are still stuck to its neck.
The rabbit turns towards me.
It's all or nothing.
I stretch out my hand.
Lightning from my hands.

*“Chain Lightning!”*

A bolt of lightning from my hands hits by blades in the neck of the rabbit.
Upon impact, the rabbit convulses.
It looks like it's a success.
The rabbit drops to the ground.
Is it dead?
Seth rushes over and flips the rabbit on its back with just one move.

“It's not dead yet!” he says.

The rabbit is still breathing.
Matthew draws his sword and stabs into the belly of the rabbit.
Blood starts spraying around.
Finally, it stops breathing.

“Seems like it's dead.”

I pull my blades from its neck and try putting the body into my Infinite Storage.
It works — it must be dead.

“Yeah…” Matt doesn't sound that happy.
I look at Matt.
He's completely drenched in blood.
I put my dominant hand on his shoulder.

*“Clean!”*

All traces of blood vanish.
Matt examines his clothes.
His mood instantly improves.

“Thanks a lot. I didn't know there was such a spell.”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Cooking After the Hunt</h1>
“I discovered that spell by accident.
I don't even know what type of magic it is, but it works.
I think that rabbit is more than enough to eat.
Should we go gather some fruits?”

“Yes, let's go.”

We move to the southeastern parts of the forest.
Upon entering the orchard of fruits, the others stand there rubbing their eyes.
I remember, apparently, those fruits are rare.

“Things are just different in this forest,” Matt finally says after a long silence.

“Oh, you're back,” I grin, “are those fruits that rare?”

“Yes, they are rare!”

“According to my Eye of Knowledge, they only grow in forests.
Did someone try to grow them a forest yet?”

“I don't know.
I'll check when I get back.
It won't be easy to cultivate those then.
You'd have to live in the forest to take care of an orchard like this.”

Hmm, I could try growing them in a forest pocket dimension.
I would need one, anyway.if I ever plan to leave the forest.
I need some safe space for my familiars. That's another item for my bucket list.

“You guys rest.
Leave the gathering to us, it's not like we helped much with the Giant Rabbit.”, Silas says.

Seth, Matt and I sit down to rest.
Matt suddenly starts petting my ears.

*Purr*, I've started purring…

“Matt!” I should stop him from petting my ears.
But I'm so sleepy…

{% scene_break leaves %}

I don't know how long I've been sleeping, but I wake up on Matt's lap.

“Ah, you've come to. The others are about done with gathering.”

We return to the cave.
The rabbit is way too big to hang from in the kitchen.
Instead, I put the dead rabbit on the floor and I call the Blood Slimes out.

“What are those?” , Matt inquires.

“Blood Slimes, they eat blood.”

They enter the body through the open wounds.
Those Slimes are surprisingly fluid.

“Usually I let them eat the blood that drops out…
I did not expect them to go directly into the body…
Maybe I should have one of them accompany me when I go hunting.
That aside.
I'm not sure if I can really dismantle that rabbit… it's quite huge…”

We break out in laughter.

“We're happy to help you with that,” Seth says.

Meanwhile, the Bloods Slimes are leaving the dead body.
It's a strange sight.
It looks like blood flowing out to form Slimes.

“In that case, I'll start preparing the other stuff.”

I go to the kitchen and prepare some fruit jelly.
After filling the forms, I let them cool down on a shelf.
I take out some Poto and cut them to sticks.
I'll fry those later.
I drop by outside to see how far the others have come.
I need some fat to fry the fries, too.

“Good timing, we're just about done here,” Seth has noticed me leaving the cave, “as I understand you'll be making food with this.
So… can we have its hide and its claws?”

“The hide and the claws? Oh yeah, sure. I can't process it, anyway.”

While I can easily get all the meat I need when I dismantle an animal, I still haven't managed to preserve the hide until now, so I have never thought about what to do with it.
“By the way,” I change back to the reason I left the kitchen, “I need some fat.”

“We're done. You can put everything into your Infinite Storage,” Sain answers.

“Should I store the hide as well? Time doesn't pass in the Infinite Storage.”

“Yes, please do. Keeping it from decomposing is very important.”

After returning to the kitchen, I put some animal fat into a pot and light the stove.
From I drop in a little Poto crumb to see if the fat is hot enough for deep-frying.
Eventually the fat around the crumb sizzles.
I put in the Poto sticks into a sieve and put it into the oil to fry.

“That smells great”, Matt enters the kitchen, “what are you making?”

“Schnitzel with fries.”

“Schnitzel with fries? I've never heard of that.”

“It's simple, but it's good. Fries are just deep-fried sticks of Poto.
As for Schnitzel, I'm about to start with those.”

I take out a chunk of meat and cut it to slices.
I mix some flour and eggs and coat the meat slices and fry them in a pan.

While waiting for the right time to flip the Schnitzel, I prepare the Wooberry sauce.
Basically, it's just mashing the berries and cooking it until it becomes viscous enough.

After flipping the Schnitzel, the fries are about done.
I pull the sieve out of the fat.
To let the fat drip down, I hang the sieve on hooks I have created on the wall.
Good thing I added those after I made the rooms for Matt's group a few days ago!
After preparing enough for everyone, we sit down and eat.
I don't have a replacement for a lemon.
So it'll have to do without.
It's not pork, anyway.

After I'm done, we prepare the table.
I also pour a bowl of wine for the Bunnyflies.
We sit down and eat.

“You were right.
It's so simple, yet it's so good!” Matt says.

Everyone seems to enjoy the food.
As do I.
How long has it bees since I last enjoyed this?
I'm glad they like it.
Though I'm still somewhat unhappy about it turned out — something is off — but I can work on that some other time.

“What's up Swift? You look like you've something on your mind.”

It looks like it's showing. Let's just tell him.

“Not much. It seems I forgot a step or two when I was cooking.
It's been quite a while since I made that.”

Now I remember!
I need breadcrumbs in the breading and I need to beat the meat before putting it into the breading.

As everyone finishes, I get the fruit jelly.

“This is called fruit jelly.”

“That looks like an unusual dessert.
How do you make it?” Matt inquires.
I'm somewhat surprised he's so interested in cooking.
Isn't he the prince of the kingdom?

“You melt Slime Gelatine and mix it with fruit juice.”

“Slime Gelatine?”

They seem shocked.

“Oh, do you have some reservations against eating Slime Gelatine?”

“No, no, it's OK. Slime Gelatine is harmless, but people usually ignore it since it doesn't help to sustain you.”

“Isn't that perfect for a dessert?”

“You're right.”

We start eating the fruit jelly..

“This is good! It just has the perfect level of sweetness!”

“I agree with Sain.”

We finish our dessert.

“Thanks for the food.”

“You're welcome.”

<h1>First Day of Real Training</h1>
“Swift, what are your plans for the rest of the day?”

“I don't have any for now.”

“So what do you usually do?”

“I usually experiment with my skills.
Sometimes I practice instead.
Though I have to admit, I'm not getting anywhere with my Short Blades Skill.”

“How about practising with Silas then?
There's only so much you can do alone,” Seth suggests.

“Can I?”

Getting some proper training could help a lot.

“Sure, at least someone is eager to train!” Seth approves.

“All right, all right, I'll train as well,” Matt reluctantly answers.

After a short rest, we leave the cave to start training.
Silas teaches me a lot: grips, maintenance, attack techniques, defence techniques…
Then we start sparring.
At first, I can barely keep up with defending against his attacks.
But eventually, I get the hang of it.

“You're a quick learner,” Silas says.
We've been training for a bell or so.

“Thanks, huff, I feel like I've made a lot of progress…”

I'm spent. I sit down on the floor to get some rest.

“Well, you got the basics down.
But you do lack stamina.”

“Huff, I haven't noticed.
How come you ever haven't broken a sweat?”

“Just lots and lots of training.
Come on, stand up, we continue with hand-to-hand combat.”

“Hand-to-hand combat?”

“Yes, you need to push yourself, but training with a weapon in that state is too dangerous.
Knowing hand-to-hand combat could help you a lot.
Besides, it seems like you're going for a Rogue skill set.”

“Is that bad?”

“No, it's not.
While some people do think it as not glamorous it is more or less a necessity for intermediate and advanced parties.
Tracking enemies, finding traps and the like.”

“So you are…”

“Yes, I'm the tracker.”

“Tracker?”

“It's just another fancy word.
Thief, Rogue, Tracker, many words for the same skill set.
Society keeps inventing new words for the same thing.
But due to how most view the job, the word becomes negative and they need a new word again.”

“I see. How about ‘intelligence specialist’?”

“That sure sounds great!” Silas laughs, “back to the topic: you need to able to trust your rogue.
That's why good rogues usually don't hide their personality to potential party members.
Though that's also the reason people don't see the job as that good.
But people need to be able to trust your true self.
I think it's a good fit for you.”

Silas helps me up to continue training.
He's merciless.
Not only am I starting to run out of stamina, but my body is also starting to ache all over.
Yet he pushes me relentlessly.
My reactions dull due to the exhaustion.
He doesn't hit hard, but still, dropping on the floor really hurts.

After I don't know how long he finally stops.

“This should do for today.
No need to push you too much.”

“Huff. Not too much? Huff. Ouch!”

I lie on the floor, limbs spread apart, breathing heavily.
My body is aching all over.
It's finally over…

“Sorry for that, it's just such a fast learner, I kinda got carried away.
Don't worry, you should get used to it soon.”

“Soon?”

“We'll be training tomorrow, too, of course.
And the day after tomorrow, too.”

Silas smiles at me.
He's way too into it… I don't think I can decline…
On the plus side, I get more training. On the flip side…

“Oh, huff, give me a break…”

Silas helps drag me back to the cave.
Matt and others are already waiting inside.

“You don't look that great”, Matt notices us coming in.

“Huff, what a coincidence! I don't feel great.”

“Well, I kinda went overboard,” Silas admits.

“That's rare!” Seth says.

“I'm sorry, but I'm too tired to talk.
I'm going to get a dip in the bath.”

“Sure.”

I plug the tub and have the Hot Springs Slimes make space for me to sit in it.
The hot water from my hot spring slowly fills it.
The Slimes start spouting hot water to fill the tub faster, “thanks, guys, I appreciate it.”

I pet the Slimes.
Some of the Slimes are joining me in the bath.
Well, I don't mind…
Hmm… This is so good!
Slowly the pain fades and I start feeling refreshed.

After the bath, I unplug the tub and I going back to the living room.

“That was just perfect. All the aching is gone, too.”

“That sounds great. Can I borrow your bath?”

“Of course you can. Just plug the tub.”

“Of course, I might be a pampered prince, but I'm not dumb.”

“Oh, that's not what I meant.
You'll see what I mean.”

“Okay…”

Matt enters the bathroom and promptly comes back.

“You have a hot spring in your bathroom?”

“Yes, I stumbled on a method to create an artificial one.
I don't have enough material for another one though.
If you're in a hurry, the Hot Springs Slimes can produce hot water as well.”

“You sure have a lot of uses for your Slimes…”

“They're so versatile!
I've just discovered those Slimes can produce hot water myself.
Though I don't think you can use those to start as an artificial hot bath.
They like hot water, too.”

“I see. I'm back to taking a bath then. Later.”

Matt leaves for the bathroom again.
Oh, I should tell the Slimes not to join him in the bath!
Here, done.

“Swift, we're about to play some cards.
Do you want to join?” Silas invites me.

“Sure, but I don't know how to play.”

“Don't worry. We'll teach you the rules.”

I wonder what kind of card game it is…

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Card Games and High-Stakes Gambling</h1>
Silas spreads out the cards: “There are four suits: swords, wands, coins, and hearts.”

Swords, wands, coins and hearts?!
That's an interesting combination.
In my previous life, the suits for playing cards were spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts.
Though tarot cards had different four suits: swords, wands, coins and cups.
I even used to divine with tarot cards.
I wonder if I can divine with these cards, as well… I'll try later.

“So each card exists in these suits?”

“Yes, the colour has numbers: one to {% include ruby base ="E" text="el" %} and an extra card called the core.”

“The core?”

“The core is a special card you see.
It's both the higher than {% include ruby base ="E" text="el" %} and lower than one.”

I guess with just those cards I can't divine, too bad.
Silas shows me some example cards.
The first card has a drawing of a sword on it.
There's the number one on the corners of the card.
The second card is empty, there are no numbers in the corners.
And there an outline of a sword on the card.
So cards are still at the very basic stage of card game evolution…

“I see. So the cards with the outline and no numbers are the core of that set.”

“For the most common game, we use one single deck.
Each person gets five cards.
You can choose how many cards you want to place with fresh ones.
The goal is to get the highest pattern.”

So it's basically poker.

“So the patterns are…”

“… from the lowest to highest: one Pair, two Pairs, a Triplet, Flow, Purity, Abundance, Pure Flow,
Apex Flow.”

“Flow?”

“That's five cards with neighbouring numbers.
A Purity is five random cards of the same colour.
An Abundance is a triplet and a pair.
A Purity Flow is both a Purity and a Flow at once.
And an Apex Flow is just a purity flow with the core as the highest card.”

“So it's just poker,” I mutter to myself…

“So you've heard of it,” Silas asks.
Oops, that could have gone terribly wrong.

“Yes, but it's been quite a while… Anyway, let's play,” he puts a small bag on the table, “do you have coins?”

“What?! We gambling right away?!”

“Well, it's no fun if we don't.”

“I don't have coins.
I haven't used money so such a long time.
I don't even know what it looks like anymore.”

“Oh, right I forgot.”

“I can make us some playing coins from glass.”

“Please do, Swift,” Seth interjects, “we shouldn't gamble with money.
It's unsightly.
But I can't deny gambling is a skill you might need in the future…
Let's play some games!”

“Alright, ”, I take some sand from my Infinite Storage, *“Vitrify!”*

The coins end up in multiple different colours.
I should check out why later.
But it's a happy little accident — I have different coloured ones!
I divide the coins into piles for everyone.
Silas deals the cards.
I've just a pair of nines.
I keep the nines and exchange the other cards.
I get a nine and a pair of ones.
Lucky me!
A Full House, I mean an Abundance.
Oh yeah, I do have Lucky Devil trait.

“And now?”

“We each show one card of our hand in turn.
If you want to drop out, that's fine.
But if you want to keep playing, you need to bet some coin.
Let me start.”

He shows a core and puts in a coin as well.

“OK,” I show one of the ones, “it's not much, but I'm in,” I push one coin to the centre.

“Daring, aren't we?” Silas answers.
He doesn't budge at all.

“I'm folding,” Seth says.
He places his cards face-down.

“So am I,” Sain follows.

“You're bluffing,” I grin.

“Am I?” He reveals another core.
And pushes in one more coin.
Uh oh, that's a pair of cores.
Maybe's he for real?
I reveal another one and push in a second coin too.

“It doesn't look good for you, Swift,” Seth says.

Silas reveals an eight and puts in a third coin.
OK, he's definitely bluffing.
I reveal an eight and put in a coin, too.

“You win. I fold,” Silas says. He turns over the revealed cards.

“Oh, you're playing cards?” Matt has just left the bathroom.

“Swift made us some glass coins to play.
So we can gamble without reservations.”

“Young Master, you can join in my place.
I'm going to take a bath,” with that Silas leaves the room.

We continue playing.
I'm winning quite a lot.

“You're quite good at this,” Matt says.

“I'm just lucky.”

“Very lucky.
Is that the famous Neotes Luck?”

“Neotes Luck?”

“Some Neotes are very lucky.
They are so lucky, we believe they have some secret blessing.
Though we've never been able to detect that.”

“You mean just like Matt's Super Intuition?”

“Super Intuition? I have that?
I read about it in our family history!
It's a trait that had been passed down in our family before.
But apparently, it was lost generations ago.”

“Maybe just the methods to detect it were lost,” I answer.

“What do you mean?”

“The Neotes Luck blessing you were talking about exists.
It's a hidden trait for Neotes called Lucky Devil.
And the Identifying Crystal you used before wasn't able to pick up that trait.”

“So your Mystic Eye of Analysis can?”

“Yes, it can.”

“Just be careful.
And don't rely too much on your traits.
And don't get addicted to gambling,” Seth sounds concerned.

“I know. I'm not keen on gambling away my pants.”

“If only it was only your pants that are in danger, I wouldn't this concerned.
Some people lost their freedom due to their debts.
Debts made worse due to gambling.”

“I see…” So debt slavery is a thing here… “I'll make sure to avoid that.”

“Let's change the topic: how about you sparring with Young Master tomorrow?
That way I can see your skills as well.”

“That's a good idea,” Silas is back from the bath.
He glances at the piles, “so you're winning lots.
Care to play another game?”

“Why not?”

“How about we make it more interesting?”

“How?”

“How about the loser spends a day buck naked?”

“Why would I…”

“Are you afraid?”

“What are you…”

“So you are afraid of losing!”

That's it, “fine! You're on!”

Silas shuffles the cards.
My first draw isn't looking great.
I sigh. I replace all the cards.

“Bad draw? Too bad.”

“Well, I can still luck out,” I draw my new cards.
Eight, nine, {% include ruby base="E" text="el" %} the core of swords and… a one of hearts.
Damn, I need the {% include ruby base="X" text="deca" %} of swords.

“I'm feeling generous. How about another swap?”

Wow, he's terribly confident!

“Hmm, sure. I'll take you up on your offer,” I replace my last card.
Jackpot! It's the {% include ruby base="X" text="deca" %} of swords.

“Since it wouldn't make sense to raise the stakes so let's just open for the showdown.
I have abundance, quite a high one.
I think you lose,” he opens this hand.
Three cores and a pair of twos.

“Too bad…” I open my hand, “I have an Apex Flow.
I win,” I smile.

“What?! But… How?!” Silas stutters.

“Well, you lose Silas. Unlike you, he didn't even cheat,” Matt says.

“He didn't? Wait, how did you even…”

“I guess the famous Neotes luck was just stronger.”

“But…”

“I should be careful about gambling?
I know,” I add.

“Then why did you…” Silas is still stuttering.

“Even if I were to lose the game, I don't have much to lose there. I live by myself in the forest.”

“A true gentleman honours debts, especially gambling debts,” Seth finally adds.

“Fine! I'll spend tomorrow buck naked,” Silas finally gives up.

<h1>Swift Mittens, the Kitten</h1>
It's about the {% include ruby base="09:00" text="nine bells" %}, and Swift still hasn't woken up.
I should try to wake him up.
If it's anything like yesterday it's going to take a while…
I go to Swift's room.
He's not there!
His clothes are, but he isn't!
I run to the living room.

“Swift has vanished!”

“Are you sure?” Seth has a questioning look on his face.

“Yes, I am. I only found his clothes.”

“But where would he go without his clothes?
Did he leave? I mean, you can only leave his room through the living room.
And we were here.”

“I don't know. All I know that he's not is room!”

“What's with the ruckus so early in the morning?!” I hear Swift's voice coming from the direction of his room.
I look in that direction.
He's not there.

“Down here.”

I look down and find a black cat.
The kitten has the same different coloured eyes as Swift has: one is sapphire, the other one is ruby.
Please don't tell me…

“Swift Mittens?! Is that you?!”

“Yes, it's me.
And no, I don't know how this happened.
I couldn't sleep all night and when I woke up, I found myself in this form…”

I grab him and pet him.

“Oh… *purr*. Oh, would you stop that! I'm not your pet! But then… *purr*.”

Hehe, I found his weak spot!
It right behind his ears.
I wonder if it's there too when he's a normal Ailuranthrope?

“I didn't know you could turn into a cat.
Is that an Ailuranthrope ability?”

“I… oh, yeah, I remember.
I do have a Hidden Trait for that.
But I've never used it.
So why am I a cat now?”

“I think you're a Lunar Wanderer.
You did say you couldn't sleep this night.
It was a full moon yesterday,” Sain explains.

“Lunar Wanderer?”

So he doesn't know about that?
But that's common knowledge!

I explain: “Ailuranthropes are commonly classified into two major variants: Lunar Wanderer and Solar Whimsical.
Lunar Wanderers suffer from insomnia on nights with a full moon: they become restless from Mana Intoxication.
Maybe your body just dealt with it by turning into a cat.”

“I see. Good to know.
I didn't exactly grow up among Ailuranthropes…”

Oh, right, he is a mixed one…

“I guess today's training is cancelled,” I say.
I think he's grinning.

“Oh, not that easy,” a buck naked Silas tries to grab Swift.
But he simply jumps away.
Silas continues: “Just because you can't hold a weapon doesn't mean you can't train.”

The next moment, Swift jumps up and lands a hit on Silas's jaw.
He flies and crashes against the wall.
That was quite a punch!

“Sorry, that punch was more powerful than I thought,” Swift apologizes, “are you alright?”

“That punch stung…
How did you do that?
There's no way that was a regular punch!”

“I dunno. I just tried punching.”

“I have an idea,” Sain says, “But let's go outside to test it.”

We leave the Bunnyflies to play on their own and exit the cave.

“So what's the idea?” Swift asks.

“Try shooting that rock over there with magic,” Sain points at the boulder nearby.

“Let's see…” Swift closes his eyes. A short while later he opens them again.

*“Fire Ball!”*

A ball of fire appears in front of Swift and flies to the boulder.

“That was also stronger than I expected.
I wonder if this is an effect of this Feline Form or just the effect of the full moon…
So, do you mind, not training today?
I think I want to make use of this excess power to create a Magic Space.”

“I see,” Seth seems very open to this.

“I think that's a good idea,” Sain adds.
It must be.
After all, Sain is our magic expert.

“Thanks,” Swift walks back into the cave.

We stay behind for a bit.

“It's sure one surprise after another with him,” Seth says.

“I don't think that's bad.
Though, we'd better tell him to keep that ability a secret…” I reply.

“I like teaching him.
He's a good student,” Silas says, “oh, it's cold…
I did not expect him to win that bet…”

“Then, I'll have a go with teaching next time as well.
I think he could use it,” Sain adds.

“It looks like he's working hard.
I should train, too,” I say.

“Then let's start,” Seth answers.

“Sain, would you…”

“Of course!” Sain, enters the cave.

Seth and I begin sparring.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Creating the Evergreen Forest</h1>
I close my eyes and concentrate on my magic.
I need to create a space that is strongly connected to my magic.
I need to imagine what features my Magic Space should have.
It's an empty space.
Time should flow at the same rate, just like it does in the world outside.
The Magic Space should have gravity just like the world has gravity…
It should have fertile soil like the world has fertile soil… and air just like the world has air… and weather… just like…

No, I don't need a copy of the forest.
This is disconnected from my surroundings!
I specify the rules.
I want eternal temperate climate spring weather!
The soil should be deep enough for tree roots to grow.
The “sun” is just a fixed light source that has the same properties as the sun, should shine and darken in daily intervals just like the real sun rises and falls.

Yes, this is the image I'm going with.
As for dimensions, I need a height big enough for trees to grow.
Let's go for twice the height of a tree.
That should be more than enough.
As for the horizontal dimensions, I leave it variable.
I just let it grow with the amount of Mana I put in.
I begin creating the Magic Space.
I can feel it slowly growing.
I should be about the size of my room now.

Oh, I still have a lot of energy.
Let's put in more Mana! And more!
My feeling tells me it's grown to about three to four times the size of my whole cave.
This is more than a good start.
But I have to stop.
I get the feeling grew too fast!
I feel the Magic Space destabilizing.
I need to stabilize it fast.

I put in Mana to the boundaries of the space to stabilize it.
Slowly the Magic Space stabilizes.
That was close!
But still, it's a success!
I open my eyes.
It seems my menu agrees.

{:.interface}
&gt; Magic Space
&gt;
&gt; You have created a Magic Space. \\
&gt; Please give it a name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\
&gt; &nbsp;\\
&gt; <span class="btn btn-outline-primary active">OK</span> <span class="btn btn-outline-primary">Cancel</span>
&gt;

I name it the Evergreen Forest.
I imagine opening a portal to the Evergreen Forest.

*“Gate: Evergreen Forest!”*

A smokey portal appears.
I walk through the portal.
I find myself that is the size I thought it would be… but it's totally barren!
I feel the earth under my paws.
The earth isn't dry; it isn't wet either.
I try using Forest Magic to grow a tree.
It's not working: nothing grows at all.

“Swift?” Sain enters the Magic Space.

“I'm here.”

“Nice space, especially for your first time.”

“Thanks.
Though I envisioned a green forest and not this barren wasteland.”

“You can't just create plants from nothing.
You need to bring in fertilizer from the outside,” Sain answers.

“Hmm… I guess I need to out of this feline form for that.
How do I do that?”

I close my eyes and imagine getting back into my catling form.
I experience a tingling sensation all over my body.
When I open my eyes, I'm back to my original height!

“You're back to normal!” Sain exclaims, “about that ability: you should be careful about whom you reveal that to.
And you might want to cover up…” He points down.

I look down and see I'm naked…

“Oh…”

This is quite a problem!
So the transformation doesn't transform the clothes with me… I quickly get a set of clothes from my Infinite Storage and get dressed.

“I might need to find a solution for this… even if it's just for my underwear.”

“I might be the magic expert of this group, but I can't help you with that.
Though I think Lady Aenwyn could help you.”

“Who's Lady Aenwyn?”

“The court mage.
She's quite knowledgeable.”

We leave the Magic Space.
I go get the Slimes in the sewers.
I think they should be able to produce fertilizer.
I lead them into the Magic Space and order them to produce fertilizer.
That's a lot of fertilizer! The Slimes are happy.
I guess the Slimes just didn't produce fertilizer because I ordered them to keep the sewer clean.

“I'll bring you here regularly to produce fertilizer.”

The Slimes answer by jumping in happiness.
I use magic to mix the fertilizer into the soil.

“That much fertilizer won't do much.
You'd need about five or six times as much to grow even just grass,” Sain says.

“I'll just have to wait for the Slimes to produce more, then. How do you know this?”

“I've learned about it before.
You should mix in some soil from the forest as well.
You were planning on trying to cultivate Tarry and Wooberry, weren't you?”

“How did you…”

“After you told us about those only growing in forests.
I got the same I idea.
It's just, I'm not good with Space Magic.
While you can grow plants with Forest Magic almost anywhere, Magic Spaces don't have the seeds you need for it to work.
So you need to bring these in from the outside as well.”

“I see. Thanks for the information. I'll start by planting some regular trees, then.”

“Let's have Silas help out, too.”

This is going to be a long-term project.
While I could use the help, this is something I ought to do myself.

“Thanks, you don't have to do that…”

“No, we insist.”

Somehow, I get the feeling everyone is way into teaching me things…
Let's poke a little.

“I'm glad you're helping me by teaching this much.
But at this point, it feels like you all have some greater motive.”

“You're sharp,” Silas enters the Magic Space, “yes, you might be right.
We do have a slight motive.”

“Silas!” Sain is shocked, “What are you talking about?”

“I just called it a motive, but it's not.
It's more like wish we share.
As you know, Young Master is the second prince.”

A wish they share?

“Yes, what does it have to do with him?”

“Well… when he comes of age, he's supposed to become an adventurer for a while…” Silas struggles with his words.

“I see. And you were hoping I'll join his party at that time?”

“We didn't talk about it.
But everyone secretly hopes you'll join him, even Matt.
We didn't talk about it because it's nothing we can do something about.
It is your decision!
Though I do have to say we enjoy teaching you.”

“What about you guys? Can't you join him?”

“We're not exactly his age… And we're not his close friends.”

“Hmm…”

“We're sorry if we offended you.
But please don't let it affect your friendship with Matt!” Sain looks very worried.

“No, no… that's not the problem!
So, when will it be?”

“It'll be when he turns {% include ruby number="12" %} so in about two years.”

Two years.
That's quite some time… Enough time to get ready.
It's not like I dislike Matt.
Going adventuring with a friend sounds enticing.

“I'll gladly go adventuring with Matt.
He's my friend after all.”

“Thanks. It'll give us peace of mind to know you're joining him.”

“In exchange, I'll take you up on my offer to help me with this experiment.”

“Experiment?”

“Well, we still don't know if Tarry and Wooberry will grow here,” I answer.
We all start laughing.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>The Large Bath in the Evergreen Forest</h1>
With the help of Silas and Sain, the Magic Space starts to fill with life.
The plan is to plant two rows of various forest trees at two neighbouring edges of the space.
I'm not using Forest Magic to speed up growth — that would deplete the nutrients in the soil too fast, so they're all saplings for now.

Sain told me there's such thing as rain in a Magic Space, so I need some other solution.
I can water them regularly, but it would be better if I can this place to be self-sufficient.
While I still have some Continuous Magic Crystal of Magic Water left, I don't enough to create a steady stream; I leave the idea of a trench of water for later and just spread the crystals out instead.
If I place a crystal each between a pair of trees, I still don't have just enough... I need to gather more.

“I need to go and try to gather some crystals for this,” I tell Sain and Silas.

“From the Crystal Down?” Sain asks.

“Yes, from the Crystal Down,” I answer.

“We'll stay here then, it's not like we can help you with that.”

“I'll be right back,” I leave for the Crystal Down.

At the Down, I scan for Continuous Magic Crystals.
I walk aimlessly across the down.
I find some Continuous Magic Crystals of Cold.
Nice, I can make a fridge with this!
But this isn't what I'm looking for…

Eventually, I find a little stream that I follow to its source.
Lucky me! Continuous Magic Crystals of Magic Water!
More than enough to create a stream.
I pocket them into my Infinite Storage.
I still have time, so I continue walking aimlessly for a while.

Oh, that's a nice cozy heat!
I find more Continuous Magic Crystals of Heat.
I could make a big bath in my Magic Space!
I can cool down the excess water and use it to water the tree.
I store those crystals as well.
I return to the cave.
I meet Matt and Seth who are still sparring.

“Oh, you're back. Did you get the crystals you need?” Matt asks.

“Yes, I did,” I go back into the Magic Space.

Sain and Silas have already dug some trenches.

“I wasn't away that long?”

“This is just some basic gardening.
Did you get what you needed?” Sain says.

“Yes, I did. Though I changed my mind about some details.”

“What details?”

“I want to put in a bath here.
I figured if I put a large one here, I can use whenever I like.”

“Isn't that overdoing it?
Most people that can make Magic Spaces just have a basic camp in there…”

“Why just a basic camp?”

“I don't know.
There are not many people that can use Space Magic.”

“I see. Anyway, those trenches you made are coming in handy.”

I take some sand from my Infinite Storage to create a Big Pool about height with steps to sit in it.
One big enough for all of us.
There should be three pillars in the centre where I can place the crystals.
Of course, I need an overflow spout in the direction of the trench as well.

*“Compaction!”*

The Pool forms, along with the pillars.
I take out more sand to make a coating of glass.

*“Vitrify!”*

The red glowing glass slowly spread across the whole construction.
I set the crystals in the same arrangement as I have in my bathroom.
Hot water starts filling the pool.
On the outside of the pool, just below exhaust spout, I place some Continuous Magic Crystals of Magic Water.
I wait for the water to overflow the tube and check the temperature of the mixed water.

“As expected, it's a tad too warm to water plants.”

I place some Continuous Magic Crystals of Cold in the path to the trench.
I check the temperature again.

“This feels about right, what do you think?”

Sain checks the temperature.

“Maybe a little colder…”

I add another Continuous Magic Crystal of Magic Water.

“That feels about right…”

“What's the matter, Sain? You seem deep in thought.”

“I wanted to teach you something as well. But I wonder if there's anything I can teach you at all…”

“What are you talking about? I'm just improvising here!”

“I see. So you don't know any spells?”

“Only those that I have discovered.”

“I see… I'll prepare something for the next visit.
Thanks a lot!” Sain's mood improves.

“No, I have to thank you.
Since the big bath is ready how about we enjoy this later?”

“Sounds great.”

Sain volunteers to make food today, so leave some meat and groceries with him.
After lunch, I go the check the trenches.
The water level is not too high, and it even reaches the opposite end.
Great! I leave the Magic Space and I spend the rest of the day sparring with Silas.

Like yesterday, he pushes me relentlessly.
But I can keep up. Barely.
Eventually, I feel confident enough to counterattack.
Of course, he just guards against it like it's nothing.
Damn... I continue trying…

“Huff, In the end, I still can't land a single hit on you.
Pant, maybe I should try again as a cat!”

“That punch this morning… I wasn't prepared for it, but still, it was quite something.
I can still feel it.”

“You can still feel it? Are you okay?”

“Yes, it's just the memory.
I'll need to start watching my back against cats now.”

We both laugh.

After dinner, we all go to the new bath.

“This feels great,” Matt exclaims.

“I agree, *purr*”, I answer.

I just can't stop myself from purring.
At this point, I just don't care about the purring anymore.
The bath feels so great! It's as if energy is flowing back into me.

“It's nice to have all of us in a bath when we're not in the castle for a while,” Seth says.

“What do you mean?” I ask.

“Well, that's the issue when you're around me.
Not all of us can be unarmed at the same time.
So usually one of them keeps watch when the rest is bathing,” Matt explains.

“I see.”

“In your case, a Magic Space is a very safe space.
Since it's impossible for people don't trust to enter,” Sain adds.

“They can't? That's great. So that would make travelling much easier.”

“You are planning on travelling?” Matt asks, “When will you go?”

“Oh, right. Today, I heard you will be becoming an adventurer for a while when you come of age.
I think I'd be joining you when that happens.”

“You will?”

“If you'll have me, of course.”

“Gladly. I'll be in your care.
I'll introduce you to the others in the group next time.”

“I hope I'm not drawing all too much trouble.
I'll be in your care.”

“Since that's settled, we just need to keep training the two of you,” Seth says.

“Please don't overdo it…”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>My First Trip to the Capital!</h1>
The next day, Matt and company leave by noon.
I join them because Seth insisted I join them on this trip to the city.
The Bunnyflies are with us.

“You've never been to the capital, right?
Please come with us, so you know the way in case you need to find us for some reason,” he said.

Seth has a point, so I give in.
We leave the forest and walk along a path eastward.
We walk for a while and the path turns into a road.

“There's not much going on here,” I say.

“People consider this forest a special place.
Several people have tried settling here and pushing the forest back.
All attempts failed,” Matt explains, “the closer they got to the Crystal Down the more they got lost.
The phenomenon only got worse when they tried to cut down parts of the forest.”

“Gathering and hunting in the lighter parts of the forest are possible.
So that's the only reason why people would show up around here.”

Not soon after, we arrive near the city gate.
The Bunnyflies hide themselves as we get closer to the city.
It's a typical European middle-ages era city wall.
No, something is different, but I can't put my finger on what is different.
The gate is closed.
The Ailuranthrope guard sees our group arriving and opens the gate.

“Welcome back!” we're greeted by the guard.
He turns to me, “may I ask who this is?”

“He's my guest,” Matt answers.

“I understand.”

“So is this a gate just for your use?” I ask.

“No,” the guard answers instead of Matt, “we received an oracle of a Giant Rabbit appearing in Avan Forest.
So the gate was just closed as a precaution.
This gate is commonly used by adventures and is the only one to be opened for free at night.
But we have to log everyone passing through here.”

“About that,” Seth interjects, “that Giant Rabbit in question was subjugated by Matt and Swift here.
Please start the resolution process.”

“Of course!”

The guard enters his post.

“Let's go,” Seth says.

We enter the capital.
As the gates are closed, there's not much going on around here.

“What's the resolution process?” I ask.

“Just sending a message to the temple to ask if a revelation came that the monster was slain.
Not that there was a second one, we missed.
That being said, we should go there and present the claws.”

Seth leads the way to a temple.
I was expecting something like a Greek temple, I mean, most of the gods I met were wearing togas, but it looks more like a Romance cathedral.
We enter.
We are greeted by a person wearing a toga.

“How may I help you?” he asks.

“Please get the head priest. It's about the conclusion of the recent oracle,” Seth answers.

The priest leaves.
Several minutes later he comes back.

“Please follow me, the head priest will see you now.”

He leads us into a big office.

“Welcome!” a woman, who I i assume is the head priestess, greets us.
She's about the same height as I.
So I assume she's a Neotes.
She looks like the very definition of an Anime grandmother.

“It's been a while, Xena.”

Her name is Xena?!
Uh oh, do not laugh! Do not laugh!
She turns to me.
I smile. Not that I can't since I'm about to break into laughter.

“And you must be the new keeper.
It's my pleasure to meet you.
I'm Xena and I'm the head priestess of this temple.”

“Nice to meet you.
I'm Swift. May I ask how you knew about me?” I reply as have tears in my eyes as I'm still trying to keep myself from bursting into laughter.

“Simple, we received an oracle about you.
Oracles are a tricky thing to read, but I'm quite accurate with it.
But I'm not infallible.
So we need multiple independent readings or proof that the Giant Rabbit was subjugated.”

“I see, I have the claws in my Infinite Storage. Shall I bring them out?”

“Please, if you don't mind.”

I take the claws from my Infinite Storage.
At that point, I hear someone knocking at the door.

“The grandmaster of the Adventurers' Guild is here.”

“Let him in,” Xena says.

A short man enters.
I assume this one to be a Neotes as well.
He looks about the same age as Xena.
He looks at the claws I have in my hand.

“I see, Giant Rabbit was subjugated.
I guess that saves me the trouble of sending out a subjugation request.
Excuse my manners. My name is Irving.”

“My name is Swift.
I currently live west of the Capital,” I keep it vague enough so it doesn't become a big thing.

“Ah, I see. I have to commend you on phrasing it like that.
So who killed this Giant Rabbit?”

“Those two did,” Seth says, pointing to Matt and me.

“It wouldn't have worked without your instructions, Seth,” I add.

“It'd be a shame not record your subjugation, so I'll have guild cards issued for you.
Please drop by later.
You can put the claw away.”

I store the claw in my Infinite Storage.

“Is it even possible for us to receive guild cards?” I ask.

“Sure, you don't have to be of age to become an adventurer, though usually you'd be restricted to low-key jobs.”

“I see. I just wonder… why are we having this talk in the temple?”

“I'd like to know that, too. ”, Matt adds.

Xena smiles, “of course, I'll tell you.
The existence of that big monster first came to light at the temple so the temple must be the one to declare the  problem is solved.”

“If it were to be discovered by adventurers, the guild would declare its existence and would also be the one to declare it's safe again,” Irwing adds.

“I see.”

Irwing turns to Seth, “You're going to get them THAT, don't you?”

THAT? Now I'm interested.
Is that the reason they were so adamant about me joining them today?

“Of course,” Seth answers.

“I'll be expecting you at the guild after that then. See you later,” Irwing leaves.

Xena has some follow up work to do so we leave. After we left the temple, Silas speaks:

“Don't ever get on Xena's bad side.
She was a very strong adventurer in her peak.
Even now, she wipes the floor with the soldier recruits that we have problems with.”

“She helps with training the recruits?”

“It's the most effective way to get them in line…
They all look down on her due to her being an elderly Neotes.
And she's fierce when you insult her.
Some people call her the Warrior Princess.”

Don't judge a book by the cover, they say. Or do judge a book by the cover? I'm not sure anymore…

<h1>Registration at the Adventurers' Guild</h1>
We arrive at a shop. Here, I notice I have a problem: I can't read the sign…

“Are those letters?” I ask.

“Oh, you're…” Silas starts, then stops, “how about we arrange for some lessons for you?
You'd have to come to the capital for those though.”

“I'm happy to take you up on that.
I'm confident I can learn.”

“I'll get back to you the next time we come to visit you.”

“Thanks a lot.”

“It's OK. It's good we can get you lessons before you start adventuring.
You don't need to be literate at the beginning.
But later, it's better if you are.
Just by then, those lessons can really get in the way of the work.”

“You sound like you're talking about the first-hand experience,” I answer.

“Yes, it was awful. I don't want to think of it,” Silas grumbles.

“Let's go in,” Seth says.

We enter the store and are greeted by a Dwarf.
He's about my height and has quite a beard.
I check my interface to check his race, and it's actually Dwarf.
So Neotes and Dwarves are different races in this world.

“Welcome. What can I do for you?”

“Good afternoon, those two have finished their subjugation and we're here to get THAT,” Seth answers.

“I see. So where the material?” the Dwarfs answers.

“Swift, can you give him the hide and the claws?”

“Sure.”

I get the hide and claws from my Infinite Storage.

“So you can use Infinite Storage? That's a rare gift!
But it also makes my job easier. But you must be tired of being kept in the dark!
Let me explain: it's a common tradition to make a good luck item for people finishing their first subjugation.
It's commonly made from the monster they killed.”

“I see,” I answer.

I hand the items to the dwarf. Examines it for a while.

“This… This is Giant Rabbit hide! Is this the one the oracle was about?”

“Yes, it is,” Seth answers.

“I see,” the Dwarf turns to me, “since I already know Matt's size, I only need to take your sizes.”

He leads me into a room and measures me.
He's taking quite a while which I find unusual.
But eventually, he finishes. I get dressed and get back to the front.

“… suggestion,” I hear Matt say.
He sees me coming and acts as if nothing has happened.
I feel like I have caught a hint of some surprise I'm going to get.
I should play along and feign ignorance.

“It'll take about two weeks,” the Dwarf says.

“See you in two weeks. Have a nice day!” Matt says.

He sees us off and we leave the store.

“Time to go to the Adventurers' Guild!” Seth says.

We arrive at a building that looks like a bar, the sign outside has a quill on it.
We enter the building.
From the inside, it also looks like a bar.
Unlike a regular bar, however, there is a prominent office area with boards and counters.

It's the late afternoon, so the guild is somewhat filled but still mostly empty.
Most of the adventurers stand in front of the bulletin boards.
The pin boards seem to be colour-coded.
The clerk is sitting on the table.
She has bunny ears.
She wears a pink cap with feathers attached to it.
See sees us coming in and waves at us to greet us.

“Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild. What can I do for you?”

“We're here to register as adventurers,” Matt answers.

“I see,” she get off the counter, “please fill out these forms. Do you need an amanuensis?”

“No, I don't,” Matt says.

“Yes, please!” I answer.

“I see,” she pulls a feather from her hat and hands it to Matt with a form.
So the feathers on her hat were actually quills!
She gets another form and starts asking questions.

“Can I have your name please?”

“Sure, my name is Swift Mittens.”

“How old are you?”

“I'm currently {% include ruby number="X" %} years old.”

“You're quite young, aren't you?”

“The guild master told us to come here.”

“Ah, I see! I heard about it. Good job!”

“Thanks.”

“So, that's all the required information.
The other information is not required.
But some info about your specialization is recommended.”

“Can I give ‘intelligence specialist’ as specialization?”

“Sure. That's not a problem.
It just has to describe your abilities without revealing your hand too much.
With this, we're done with the registration.”

Matt hands her his form.

“Thank you. Since you're all underage, you'd usually need to pass a battle assessment.
But with the guild master's authorization, you're exempt from that.”

She put two translucent cards on the counter.

“I need a drop of blood on those cards to attune these cards to you.”

She gives us a needle each. I poke in my left index finger and let a drop fall on the card.
The card shines for a brief moment and turns red copper.

“By the way, I'm Lynette Taru, a Kouniklanthrope.
Since you're just registering for formalities, I will just explain how Guild Cards work: the have your name, your party affiliation, and your specialization on it.
The colour of the card is your current rank.
You're currently bronze rank.
These cards can also serve as your identification.
Please don't lose those!
Reissuing them costs money depending on your rank but at least one Gold Coin.”

“Identification?”

“Yes,” she picks up my card, “if someone who's not their owner holds the card for more than
{% include ruby number="X" %} seconds it turns translucent.”

Just as she says it, the card turns completely translucent. She gives me my card back.

“But if you get it back, it will become the correct colour again.”

And it does turn back to bronze.

“Can I have your cards for a minute to record your feat?
Also, I'll make a note on your cards so you'll get your full orienteering when you actually start adventuring.”

I give her my card and she put it into recess on her side of the counter.
Then, she taps a metal plate on her counter and letters appear on the plate as if that plate were a tablet!
I wonder how it works…
After tinkering a while, she gives me back my card.
I put it into my Infinite Storage.
And repeats the same procedure with Matt's card.
Since we're done here, we leave the building.

Matt's group escorts me to the western gate.

“Thanks for taking me along.”

“We're glad to have you. Will you find you way back?”

“Don't worry, I'll manage. Goodbye, until next time.”

“Until next time.”

I show my guild card to the guard and make my way towards the forest.
When I'm far enough from the city the Bunnyflies make themselves visible again.
When we arrive at the cave, I pour the Bunnyflies another bowl of maple wine.

*«I hope you weren't too bored.»*

It's already dark outside, but it's still early so I figure I should try experimenting some more.
I should try getting the hang of the Feline Form transformation.

I close my eyes and I imagine turning into a cat.
When I open my eyes, I'm the height I was yesterday morning.
My clothes have fallen off me.
Can I transform without closing my eyes?
I try. It works.
Without bothering to get dressed, I try transforming into a cat while I jump on to my bed.
I can barely make it in time and my footing is slightly off, but it works.
Transforming is tiring... I should just drop here on my bed… and sleep…

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Sky Salmon and Sky Salmon Stew</h1>
The next day, I wake up at about {% include ruby base="0E:00" text="eleven bells" %}.
I don't have much to do today.
So I'll continue testing what I can do with my Feline Form.
I haven't checked the state of the Evergreen Forest yesterday, so I open a portal to that Magic Space.

*“Gate: Evergreen Forest!”*

The known smokey portal appears and I enter the space.
I just can't shave off that fear the humidity in this place would be too high.
But the air feels OK — I don't how it exactly works, but it doesn't matter.
I walk over to the edge where we planted the trees.
The soil below my paws is moist, not too wet.
Content with the state of the Evergreen Forest, I leave the Magic Space and close the portal by cutting off the Mana supply.

Let's take a stroll in the forest!
When I leave the cave, I see clouds are gathering.
It's probably going to rain today.
The forest is noisy.
The birds are more or less screaming.
As if the world is about to end…
My stomach tells me to return to my cave soon, but I ignore it and stay.
Suddenly, everything is silent.
What happened?

Then… it starts pouring...
Yuck! The rain feels nasty!
No wonder cats are afraid of water.
I hurry back to the cave.
When I arrive I'm soaking wet.
Yuck! How do I shake the water off?
Like this? No, that's too slow.
I try again. Faster. Faster! Ahh, I'm back to being dry.

But what do I do now?
I don't want to go out, not with this weather.
And there's nothing to do here…
I throw myself into bed, close my eyes, and try dozing off.
Yeah, with this weather nothing beats sleeping!

{% scene_break leaves %}

When I wake up again, I can still hear the heavy rain falling…
I yawn.
It's back to sleeping, I guess.
I close my eyes again and continue sleeping.

{% scene_break leaves %}

I wake up again, I can still the rain but it's not as heavy as before.
I decide to try to take another stroll in the forest.
I leave the cave and climb a tree.
Well, I jump up into the trees, at least I try to.
It takes me several tries to get it right.
I need to get used to doing this in feline form.
I jump from treetop to treetop.
Surprisingly, I get the hang of it quite fast.

I go from the eastern part of the forest to the southern part as I encounter salmon flying about.
Salmon flying in the air!
I want to rub my eyes, but that doesn't work since I'm still a cat.
I analyze the fish.

{:.interface}
&gt; Sky Salmon
&gt;
&gt; This fish usually dwells in the skies.
&gt; Sometimes, weakened Sky Salmon can be found near the ground after heavy rainfall.
&gt;

Did they drop to the ground level because the air pressure changed?
No, by that logic, they'd have to drop down here *before* the rain.
Or have they been resisting the fall and dropped down to this level after they ran out of stamina?

Anyway, it's time to catch some fish.

*“Chain Lightning!”*

Ouch! That hurt! I've zapped myself…
It's still tingling…
So using Lightning Magic in the rain is a no-go…
So what do I do instead? Let's try lasering them!

*“Laser!”*

I hit several Sky Salmon with that single shot.
They drop to the ground.
The air smells like burnt flesh.
I should be careful about where I shoot this spell.
I continue shooting them.
After hitting several dozen of them, I jump off the tree I was standing on and collect the dead Sky Salmon into my Infinite Storage.
If only I had some Nori and rice…
I bet this salmon would make some great sushi!
Maybe I can find some in the city.
I add “Making Sushi” to my bucket list.

I'm starting to get hungry.
It should be about time for dinner.
Let's try to make some salmon stew!
I return to the cave.
I shake my fur dry and turn back into my Ailuranthrope shape and get dressed.

I take out one Sky Salmon from my Infinite Storage.
I get my short blade and run it on the outside of the salmon to descale.
My glass knives would probably shatter if I tried descaling a fish — I don't want glass shards in my food, so I'm not going to even try to see if they would really shatter.
I should get a real kitchen knife or a multi-purpose knife.
I cut open the salmon and paunch it.
Then, I carefully trim the meat of the spine.

I cut the chunks down to palm size.
I wished I had some pineapples to go with this.
But I don't so it's time to improvise.
I put the fish fillets into a pot along with vegetables and spices.
I pour in some vinegar for the sourness, too.
I bring the pot up to boiling temperature and let it simmer for a bell or two.

It's tasty, but with the proper ingredients, it'd be so much better!
I really need to source ingredients.

<h1>A Shopping Trip Gone Wrong</h1>
A few days later, I make my way to the capital for a shopping trip.
I show my guild card to the guard — he's a very nervous Kouniklanthrope — and enter the city.

“You're way too young to have a card! Whom did you steal it from?!” I hear a shrieking voice yelling.
I turn towards the voice.
A Hume woman, she's got quite the hairdo, looks condescendingly at me.
This smell like trouble…

“This is my guild card. It would…”

“You're lying! No way filthy demihuman your age could get something like that!”

A racist… this exactly why I think being around other people is such a drag…

“Seriously, a guild card…” I'm interrupted yet again.

“Stop lying!”

“Is something amiss?” the guard that just let me in left his station.

“Arrest this boy! He's stolen someone's guild card!”

“B-but… that card is…” the guard stutters.

“Don't you know who I am? Do as I say or I'll make sure you'll lose that pathetic job of yours!”, the woman yells.

“Lady, you're being unreasonable,” a Hume girl about my age comes to our help.

“Quiet, lass, don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong!” the woman just brushes the girl off like that.

“I could say the same to you, Lady Luket. You. Are. Being. Unreasonable!” the girl exclaims loudly but still not threatening.

“How dare you address me like this?! Respect your elders!” the woman yells.

“Respect is something you earn, Lady Luket.
Yelling doesn't earn you any respect,“ I hear Matt's voice, “you'd better stop this.”

“I am trying to have this lowly demihuman thief arrested.
And you are getting in the way!” she yells at Matt.

Matt sighs and takes out a pocket watch.
He exclaims: “With my authority of being the Second Prince, Guard Captain Seth, arrest Lady Luket for public disturbance, violation of the Banned Terms Act, discriminating wrongful accusation and harassing a state guest.
Also have Lord Luket suspended until the trial.
Send a messenger to him to convey the news.”

Why has this trip gone so wrong…

“At once,” Seth answer and addresses the Kouniklanthrope guard, “you heard the Second Prince.
Please help me escort Lady Luket to her cell.”

The guard salutes and helps drag the woman away.
She's screaming profanities as she's being dragged away.
All while the crowd that has started gathering is cheering.

“Isn't this overkill?” I ask.

“No, it's not.
She's been harassing non-Humes for quite a while…
As you can see from the cheering, people around here are quite happy about her getting dragged away,” the girl answers.
She then turns to Matt, “you said state guest.
Would you kindly introduce us?”

I take a closer look at Matt's group.
The girl has long ginger hair.
There's also an Ailuranthrope boy with white hair and a Cynanthrope girl with dark skin and white hair with them.

“Of course. Kat, Luna, Pat, this is Swift Mittens.
He's the keeper I told you about,” he answers and points to the Hume girl, “Swift, this is Katherine Farron, she's my fiancee.”
He points to the other two, “and this is Patrick Boots and Luna Bella, my aides.”

“Pleased to meet you. Please call me Kat.”

“Pleased to meet you. Call me Luna.”

“Pleased to meet you. Call me Pat.”

“Pleased to meet you. Call me Swift.”

“So…” Matt addresses me, “what brings you here?”

“I figured I should sell some animal hides I have and buy some ingredients for cooking.
While I appreciate you bring stuff to the forest, I decided I can't depend on you for everything.
So I wanted to go shopping on my own before meeting you in a few days.
After all, when we start travelling we should be able to depend on each other.
But so far, my first solo trip to the capital hasn't been that uneventful as I had hoped.
There is reason why I like keeping to myself in the forest.”

“Travelling? Ah, so you will be joining us,” Kat answers.

“I was going to tell you about it today.
After all, I did not expect to run into Swift today.
But since that incident just happened, you need to stay with us until that matter is settled.
I hope you don't mind.”

“I take that over getting yelled at for no reason,” I laugh.

“You wanted to sell animal hides, didn't you? Let's go to the Gromli's shop.”

We move to the armour shop where we were two days ago.
I enter the shop alone while the others wait outside.

“Welcome! You're way too early.”

“I have some animal hides I wanted to sell.
I also wanted to buy an all-purpose knife and some kitchen knives if you have some.”

“I see, I'll buy them, but the price depends on the quality.
You to know you could sell them at the Adventurer's Guild?”

“Is there a rule about it?”

“No, it's just outside the guild, you might get taken advantage of.”

“You seem to be a trustworthy person.
I mean, you were introduced to me by Matt.”

“Yes,” we start laughing, “but be careful about who you trade with.”

I take out a few dozen hides from my Infinite Storage.
The shopkeeper checks them carefully.

“How about {% include ruby number="200" %} Tol for the whole stack?
Plus a set of kitchen knives.”

I don't have any idea how money in this world works.

“Yes… I'll take it. Thanks.”

The dwarf gives me a bunch of copper coins and one silver coin.
The copper coins are of two different shapes: the usual circular disc and a long Koban coin shape.
Usually, you're supposed to count those now, aren't you?
The dwarf notices my confusion. He sighs and tells me.

“Put them on the table.
I'll help you.

This is a smallest coin, the Round Copper Coin.
It's worth one Tol.

“Thanks for the explanation!”

He hands me a set of kitchen knives as well.
I put the knives and the money into my Infinite Storage.

“Usually I'd offer you an all-purpose knife as well, but can you wait till the end of the week?”

“Sure. Again, thanks for your help.”

“No, thank you for doing business with me.
Those hides were almost perfect.
You just need a good all-purpose knife.
Please bring more if you have time.
Is there something else I can help you with?“

“Yes, as a matter of fact, there is,” I take out a bottle of Maple Wine from my Infinite Storage, “I was wondering where
I can sell this.”

“That colour!” the dwarf exclaims, “I can smell a whiff?”

“Yes, sure.”

“This is Maple Wine! How did you get it?”

“I made it myself. It's my first batch.”

“Your first batch? I'll buy all you want to sell! By the way, my name is Glorindamli.”

Glorindamli? Didn't Matt call him Gromli?

“Nice to meet you. I'm Swift.
At the moment, only my Bunnyflies and I drink that.
So I just have four bottles I can sell.
But if it sells well, I'll make a bigger batch.”

“I'm quite sure it'll sell.
It's not as good at the stuff at home, but I'm sure the dwarves in town will like it.
So this is your first batch… I'll buy the four bottles for one small Silver each, that's 400 Tol.”

“Isn't that too much?”

“It's a rarity around here, so it's justified.”

“If you say so.”

After exchanging four bottles of Maple Wine for money, I say goodbye and leave the shop.

<h1>Matthew Sitnalta Ace Prosecutor</h1>
Swift has just bought some vegetables and rice.
Since he's done with his shopping we go to the castle.
In the castle, we run into Aenwyn.
Good, Aenwyn can distract Swift while I take care of the upcoming trial!

“Is that him?” she asks.

“Yes, it is,” I answer and turn to Swift, “Swift, this is Lady Aenwyn.
Lady Aenwyn, this is Swift.”

“Pleased to meet you.”

“Pleased to meet you.”

“Lady Aenwyn, good to meet you.
I was hoping you would teach Swift reading and writing and share your knowledge about magic, of course.”

Lady Aenwyn looks at me as if she's about to disagree.
But upon looking in my eyes she doesn't.

“I… I'll see what I can do.”

“Thanks a lot.”

“Thank you for your time,” Swift says.
Lady Aenwyn leads Swift to her office.

“Now, let's meet with father.
But before that, we need to make ourselves presentable.”

We move to our rooms to change into formal clothes and make our way to the throne room.

“Matthew, there you are!
I heard you ordered the suspension of Lord Luket,” father says the moment he sees us entering the room.
Lord Luket is in the room as well.

“Yes, I did,” I answer, “it's just a formality.
I'm sure his majesty must have gotten the report about how I was forced to have his wife detained for multiple offences.
Since it's his wife, it's standard protocol to suspend him until the trial is resolved.”

“I see,” father says, “from the formal way you're holding yourself, I also conclude you'll be the prosecutor for the trial and you're ready.”

“Yes, after all, my honoured guest was insulted,” I answer.

“As discussed before, I'll act a defence for my wife,” Lord Luket says.

“Since you insist, do as you please. Bring her in!” father commands.

The guards lead Lady Luket in.
She glares at me as she moves next to her husband.

“We begin the trial.
Prosecutor Matthew Sitnalta, begin.”

“The defendant, Lady Claire Luket, is being accused of public disturbance, violation of the Banned Terms Act, discriminating wrongful accusation and harassing a state guest,” I begin.

“What is the defendant's side on those matters?” father asks.

“The defendant insists on those allegations being unfounded,” Lord Luket answers.

“Then, let me present this letter of complaint we received recently from the Adventurers' Guild,” I hand the letter to father, “in the last few weeks, several adventurers were coerced into giving up their guild cards and those guild cards we delivered to the guild by servants of the defendant's house.
All adventurers were able to describe the defendant as the perpetrator.
When we encountered her in the act, we were trying to persuade the defendant from stopping her actions.
As there was no opportunity to convince the defendant to stop, we decided on her arrest.”
Take that!

Lord Luket has a look of defeat on his face.
Lady Luket isn't convinced yet.

“Objection! The letter from Adventurers' Guild is not trustworthy!” she yells.

“Objection declined!” father gavels, “only Lord Luket who acts as your defense would be able to raise an objection.
And even if he did, I have determined the letter to be real and valid.”

“We should give up, honey.
Please accept the blame and properly apologize to everyone…” Lord Luket whispers to his wife.

“I am a strong proud independent woman, I'm not apologizing to some demihuman scum!” she yells.
I can see her wig is slightly displaced.

The room becomes noisy. Lord Luket desperately tries quiet his wife but fails.

“Are you… planning on continuing like this?!” father asks.
Father never shows his emotion in public.
But his anger slightly shows.
He always talks slower when he's angry and can't show his emotions.

Before Lord Luket can say anything, Lady Luket answers: “Yes!”

She takes her wig and throws in my face…
This feels unpleasant but I shrug it off wordlessly.

“I declare the defendant guilty on all terms.
I also declare the defendant guilty for contempt of the court.
The summary verdict is: the defendant is sentenced to death.
House Luket is to be stripped of their title and their land.”

Father gavels. Hard. It's plain visible he's angry.
The room is in total silence.
My plan was just to get them a fine so she'd stop that nonsense.
I did not expect her to self-destruct in the trial.
I feel a little bad for the now former Lord Luket.
Now he lost everything due to this. He deserves better.

“Your Majesty,” Kat breaks the silence, “may I suggest a method of execution?”

“Go ahead, Katherine Farron.”

“As the defendant claims ‘I am a strong proud independent woman’ she can demonstrate that in the coliseum.”

“I agree, make it so!” he gavels again, “The court is adjourned.
Lead Ms Luket to her cell.
Everyone but the group of Prince Matthew leave the room.”

Everyone but my group and father leaves the room.
It's total silence again.

“In all my years I have never seen anyone do that in a trial…” father says and sighs, “I don't mind much if people care less about etiquette when we're in private.
But I can't let something this slide while I'm acting as the ruler.”

“We only planned to fine them,” I answer.

“I know,” father answers, “but Kathrine, even with all that happened, I'm surprised you'd suggest something like the coliseum.”

“The way she meant what she said really bothered me.
I am a young independent woman and I'm not a douchebag.
I'm not keen on this, but since I'm the one that suggested it I have the duty to watch what I caused…”

“Kat, you don't have to,” I answer. I really mean it.

“No, Matt, I'm not irresponsible.”

“I'll be there with you.”

“Thanks.”

Silence again…

“On the plus side, House Luket isn't going to cost us anymore…”

“Just what do I tell Swift…” I don't really know.
I don't think I should tell him about what's happened. He might feel responsible for all of this.

“I'll spend some time with him and tell him after that,” Patrick says, “I should get to know him anyway, we *are* supposed to become a party soon.”

“I'll leave it to you then.”

I really don't want to think about what comes next…

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Spinning Magic Yarn</h1>
After changing back into my normal clothes, I go to Lady Aenwyn's office.
I knock on the door.

“Who is it?”

“It's Patrick Boots.”

“Please enter.”

I open the door and enter her office.
It's messy as always.
Swift is sitting near the window and reading… the Encyclopedia Magicka?!

“The Encyclopedia Magicka?!”

“Yes, he's gotten the hang of reading basics quite fast.
It's easier to practise reading if you read something that interests you.”

“I'm still too slow…
So I can't enjoy it yet.
But I'm learning quite a lot about magic.”

I still don't know why, but something about Swift is so entrancing…

“By the way,” Swift puts down the book, “how did Matt's business go?”

Matt's business?
Oh, the trial!

“The tri…, I mean, the business did not as expected.
Matt has got some follow-up business to attend to.
So I'll be keeping you company instead.”

“I see, he doesn't have it easy…”

I breathe heavily.
I have to tell him the truth.

“Swift, please stay calm, I need to tell you something about the business Matt was attending to…”

“But Patrick…” Lady Aenwyn interjects.

“No, we shouldn't keep from him…”

“So it's about that woman, Lady Luket?” Swift asks.

“Yes, it is.”

“So… let me guess: for some reason, she's gotten sentenced to death.”

“Erm… yes.
How did you know?”

“Just guessing from how you're acting.”

“You aren't angry?”

“Even though she did bring it upon her herself
I do feel a little responsible.
But just be honest with me, why capital punishment?”

“She… committed contempt of court. Multiple times.
With the king as the judge.”

I tell him about what Matt had originally planned and what had transpired in the throne room.

“So should I get you a seat in the coliseum?”

“Sorry, what?”

“Do you feel responsible for her fate?”

“I do… a little.
But as you told me, she self-destructed and more or less insulted the king.
I feel me going there would just be me expressing my schadenfreude so I'll happily refrain from that.”

He continues reading out his book.
He does at a slow but steady pace.
I sit down and watch him.
I could watch him like this forever…

“Don't start drooling while watching him!” Lady Aenwyn whispers to me.

“What? Me?!” I answer.
I can feel my face turning red.

After a while, Swift puts down the book again.

“Lady Aenwyn,” he says, “I just remembered.
Sain suggested me asking you about this.
Let's start at the beginning: do you know about my Ailuranthrope abilities?”

“Your Ailuranthrope abilities? No, I don't,” Lady Aenwyn answers.

“I can turn into a cat.”

He can? Well, I can, too.
But that's not something you share with others.
Doesn't he have any basic…
Oh, wait, he didn't grow up among Ailuranthropes!

“You can?
No, that shouldn't be surprising, after all, lots of Cynanthropes and Lycanthropes can.
And it's been postulated other Therianthropes can, too,” Lady Aenwyn tries to hide her excitement.

“Well, at least with Ailuranthropes,” I interject, “we don't like bragging about our abilities.
That includes showing them in public.”

I jump on the table while transforming into a cat.
My clothes fall down to the floor.

“Oh, you can, too?” Swift sounds excited, “as you can see, the clothes fall off when transforming.
It's inconvenient being naked when turning back.”

“I agree. It's very inconvenient being naked when turning back.”

“I see,” Lady Aenwyn answers, “as far I know, Lycanthropes are known to not care about that.
Cynanthropes have come up with a solution, at least for fabric.
It should work for the two of you as well. Let's go to the workshop!”

“Great! Thanks.”

“Well, you go on ahead,” I answer, “I need to get dressed first.”

“We'll wait outside,” Lady Aenwyn and Swift leave the room.

I turn back into my Ailuranthrope form, get dressed quickly and follow them.
In the workshop, Lady Aenwyn addresses a Cynanthrope aide: “We need two Magic Spindles for those two.”

We're led into a room. Lady Aenwyn shows us how to use that tool.

“Just pour your Mana into it and roll up the thread you receive.
While it'd be better if you can manage a stable Mana output, the tool is able to adjust for you to a certain extent.
The thread is called Magic Yarn.
Since it's made from your Mana, it's a part of yourself and transforms with you.
Usually, only Cynanthropes use it for transforming.
Others use it as a premium resource.”

“Premium resource?” Swift asks.

“It's very comfortable and durable.
A set of clothes made from Magic Yarn usually lasts for dozens of years.
It can only be worn by the one who created the Magic Yarn.
For other people it usually feels unsettling to wear them.
The only downside is it can't be enchanted.
So it can't be used for protective gear.

But if Ailuranthropes are really that secretive about their abilities, it's might become a problem with the budget allocation for Magic Yarn.”

“Well, most Ailuranthropes don't even know that Magic Yarn could be used for that,” I add, “even less use their ability to transform.
Some say turning into a cat is being too unrefined…

Ailuranthrope high society is all about acting more refined.
Some would happily give up their tails if it wouldn't mess up their sense of balance.
I think in truth they're just still not over the Hume supremacists.
Oh, I'm rambling too much. Sorry about that.”

“Don't worry about it, it gave a lot of insight into Ailuranthrope high society,” Swift says.

“I agree,” Lady Aenwyn says, “we'll just run the costs for your Magic Yarn as running research costs.”

“What costs are involved?” Swift asks.

“Various things.
The most expensive part is getting Sky Salmon scale power that acts as a catalyst.”

“I see,” Swift answers.
He's already finished a half spindle.
I'm really struggling with this one.
What is he? How is he spinning those so fast?!
I need to just power through. I am the healer of the group.
I should be the last person to give up!

“It's sure draining…” I sigh.

“You'll get used to it,” Lady Aenwyn answers.

At the end of the day, I have three spindles.
Swift has five. We get our sizes taken.

“It's already late, we'll order your stuff tomorrow.
It should be done in a week or two.”

“Thanks for your help! See you around!”

“Thanks for your help!”

I lead Swift to Matt's office.
Luna is waiting in front of the office for us.

“Hey Luna, how are things going?”

“Prince Matthew has finished the documentation and the time for the execution has been decided for tomorrow,” Luna answers in her usual non-emotional tone.

“That's way too fast.”

“The guards have asked for a faster schedule.
Anyway, it's about dinner time. We should enter.”

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Slime Jelly Production Talks Before Dinner</h1>
Pat called it Matt's office.
But it looks more like a full apartment similar to the layout of my cave.
The only difference is his main area being an office.
Matt and Kat are already there.
These also an older Hume in the room.

“Hey, how was your time with Lady Aenwyn?” Matt asks.

“Great, I learned a lot, thanks.
How are things on your end?”

“I'm done for today.
But I have some unpleasant business to attend to tomorrow.
So I can't spend the day with you.”

“It's not your fault she was being unreasonable.”

“I know, but even so…
Wait… how do you even about this?!”

“I told him about it,” Patrick calmly says.

“I've already told Patrick.
Me being present there would just be me expressing my schadenfreude, so I'll refrain from spectating.”

“I see.
You do know my father would possibly consider pardoning her if you were to ask him.”

“Me? Why me?”

“You are the keeper of the Crystal Down.
While you don't have the power, you do have quite the influence.”

“I'll keep that in mind.
I hear the schedule is quicker than usual.
Is there a special reason for that?”

“She was constantly nagging and screaming profanities at the guards and other prison inmates.
They asked to move forward the schedule before something happens.”

“I have to say I don't feel bad for her.
However, I do feel bad for her husband.
How is he coping with the situation?”

“I have given up on saving my wife,” the man answers, “I've realized anything is futile as long as she isn't willing to compromise.”

“I'm sorry to hear that,” I really am.
You probably deserve better, “I don't want to be mean, but if she were to compromise…”

“I thank you for your kind offer, but knowing my wife, it's not going to happen.
But I'll keep it in mind for the off case a miracle happens.”

“Lord Luket…”

“Prince Matthew, please call me Alexander, I don't have my title anymore.”

“Only if you stop calling me ‘Prince’!”

“Sigh… Yes, as you ask, Pr…, Matthew.
People will probably not ask me to act as their defence in trials anymore.
I'll probably take up cooking again,” Alexander says.

“You can cook?” Matt asks, “I didn't know you could do that!”

“I haven't cooked much since I married into House Luket.
I have to brag, I used to make quite tasty treats,” Alexander explains.

“Swift also makes great food.
That fruit jelly he made was really good.”

“Fruit jelly?” Alexander asks.

“It's just cooking fruit juice.
Let it cool down a little and then mix it with Slime Jelly,” I explain.

“That's simple.
I can only imagine how it the product would turn out…” he says.

“It's almost dinnertime, so I'll just get a little sample from my Infinite Storage for you to taste,” I give him a small cube fruit jelly.

“This is great!!” he exclaims, “is it alright to tell me the recipe?!
You could earn a lot of money!!”

Let's begin the talks.

“It's nothing,” I answer, “there's so much more I want to make.
But back to the jelly: I hear people just don't use Slime Jelly; it's being ignored by people.”

“You're right… and hiring adventures just to bring Slime Jelly isn't that viable.”

“How about cultivating Slimes?
As far as I know, Slimes produce Slime Jelly when you feed them Fat,” I suggest.

“That's a good idea!” Alexander is excited.
His excitement soon turns to despair though, “just too bad, I don't have to funds to start something like this anymore.”

“How about I give you the funding to start the project?” Matt suggests.

“But… I can't possibly ask this of you!” Alexander resists.

“I have a personal interest in the project, too.
And I know you are a person who can make it work.
Anything else is irrelevant.
Even though I was planning on arranging some money for you from the start.
This works better since I have another real motive.”

“But… thank you very much. I'll make it succeed,” Alexander is back to full vigour.
He switches gears quite fast, especially for an old man like him.

“I'd be great if you the recipe would spread…” I say.
Then it wouldn't be a strange food anymore.

“I'll make it happen.”

“About the method to get Slime Jelly, I don't mind if you keep it to yourself a little longer to make the production profitable,” I add, “also one hint about handling Slime Jelly: just melt it, but don't boil it.
It won't turn back to jelly if you do.”

While we were discussing, the maids have brought in the food.
After eating dinner, we move to the lounge and continue talking.
Patrick sits next to me. He sways as if he's about to fall over.

“Are you OK?” I ask.

“I'm just a little tired.
Helping with Lady Aenwyn's research was a bit draining,” he says.

“I can…” Kat begins but she stops are Patrick shakes his head.

“It's about Ailuranthropes,” I answer in his stead.

“I see…” Kat answers, “do your best.”

Patrick leans on my shoulder.
I'm somewhat surprised, but I don't dislike it. So I let him.

“It's late.
So I'll return tomorrow so we can write up an agreement on the Jelly,” Alexander says.

“Let's do that,” Matt answers.

“Goodbye,” I carefully wave as Patrick has fallen asleep on my shoulder. Alexander leaves.

“That's rare! Pat is usually quite averse against body contact,” Katherine says.

“Hard to imagine,” I say, “I meant to ask what you guys specialize in.
I've gotten training from Silas as Tracker — my guild card says ‘Intelligence Specialist’.
I also have some magic skills.”

“I'm a paladin,” Matt answers, “Patrick is our healer.”

“I'm a swordswoman,” Luna says. She still sounds very unemotional.

“I'm an attack magic-user,” Kat says.

“I'll do my best.”

I carefully move Patrick off my shoulder. Matt puts a blanket on him.

“I wonder what you guys did…
I've never seen him so worn out,” Matt says.

“I'd like to tell you, but Patrick told me it's improper for Ailuranthropes to talk about certain things,” I answer.

Matt shows me to a guest room before he leaves for his own room.

*“Gate: Evergreen Forest!”*

I enter my Magic Space and take out my set of kitchen knives and some Sky Salmon from my Infinite Storage.
I descale the Salmon and put both the descaled Sky Salmon and the scales back into my Infinite Storage.
I continue until I finish descaling all the Sky Salmon.
I hope this is enough to cover for Patrick's and my Magic Yarn needs…

I return to my room and go to sleep…
This bed feels way too comfortable. *Purr*…

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Reading and an Unexpected Find</h1>
The next morning, Patrick leads me to Lady Aenwyn's office again.

“Good morning!
How was your night?” Lady Aenwyn greets me. She looks somewhat sleepy.

“Good morning! I had a good rest,” I answer, “by the way, I happen to have some Sky Salmon scales.”

She looks at me in disbelief.

“Really, I have some Sky Salmon in my Infinite Storage.
I just hadn't descaled them.”

She gets a plate, “Please put them here. I'll have it analyzed.”

I put the scales from my storage onto the plate.
She carries the plate somewhere.
A few minutes later she storms back.

“Wha-what's your price for those scales?!” she asks.
She is visibly excited.
She does seem to get excited very easily.

“Hmm, how about you let Patrick and I make Magic Yarn whenever we need?”

“That's a deal!” she writes down something, “I'll get this processed.
Make yourself at home,” she storms out with the scales and the note.

“Are you sure about this?” Patrick asks.

“I don't really need the money.
The yarn is more valuable to me.
As for your part, I'm just more comfortable with this arrangement.
Spinning yarn alone is boring.”

“Thanks…”

I take the book I read yesterday and continue reading.
The Encyclopedia Magicka… it could use some colour-coding for the Magic Elements used.

“I heard you are a healer,” I put the book down again and try to begin a conversation.

“Yes, I am.
I've… always had good compatibility with Light Magic.”

He's hesitating?
Why?

“But you aren't a cleric?”

“No, I don't have the Oracle Skill for that.
I'm… not cut out for paladin, too.
I'm very bad with the sword.”

“I see,” I answer, “is something the matter?”

“I'm just a simple Light Mage.
My Light Magic doesn't have holy properties.”

“Where's the problem?”

“I can't do anything for the party but healing and providing light!”

“That's the most important job in a party!
I don't see the problem.”

“But I feel so useless!”

Oh, I see…

“And you aren't good with weapons?”

“No, I've tried swords, lances, clubs and even close combat… I'm just no good at it.”

I take a look at his Character Window.

{% include character/window.md character="patrick-1-36" %}

Sure Strike, a trait that has a chance to guarantee a hit.
So…

“What about archery?” I suggest.

“I haven't tried that yet.”

“Do try it.
But even if that doesn't work, having a healer in the party is important.
Besides, with the right spells, you can even attack using Light Magic.”

“I will.
Maybe that's something I can do.
Thanks for the suggestion.”

“You're welcome.
I'm quite sure you can pull that off.”

“Why are you so sure?”

“I'd like to think I have good eyes for that.”

“I see…”

I continue reading the book.
In. V. O. C. A. Tion. Invocation. Me. Th. O. D. Method. Invocation Method.
I'm getting better at reading the characters in this script.
I can already recognize recurring patterns. Sometimes the letters throw me off a little.
Sometimes an S looks like a T. I still haven't found out the reason why...

If I understand this entry correctly, there are two main invocation methods for magic: Incantations and Short Spells.
I've only used Short Spells so far — just imagining the effect of the spell and shouting the spell name.
But it only works if you have an affinity to the type of magic in question.

Incantations offset part of the imagining into words to ease casting, but it's quite lengthy, so it's rarely used.
Incantations can also make up for a lack of affinity to the type of magic in question.

Incantations can also be used to cast greater spells in unison with other people.
You need to have great trust in each other to be able to pull that off, it says.
Maybe we can do that later.

“You're improving quite fast,” Patrick says.

“Thanks,” I answer, “but it feels to me more like I'm remembering how to read.”

“I see,” Patrick leaves and comes back with another book.
It's older, but on the cover, I can see it's written in Latin Script!
But I can't read it. The language is unlike any language I've seen.

“What's that?” I ask.

“There are some legends about this book,” he answers, “would you try to look into it?”

“Sure.”

I take in and browse through the book.
I find several groups of letters that keep repeating.
Is this book encoded?
I scan for the number of distinct two-letter and three-letter groups.
This might be encoded with some substitution cipher, maybe just a Caesar Cipher.

“I might have a closer look into it sometime in the future.
But for now, I only have some guesses.
It's quite an unusual script, isn't it?”

“It's ancient writing.
But those are usually carved in stone, not written into paper books.
Some people say it has been left by the previous hero — a text written in a way only the next hero can read it,” Lady Aenwyn answers instead.

“Why would he need to do that?”

“It's said it details very powerful magic.”

I give decoding it a try. Let's see…
Counting the frequency of that letter with its position is the
groups I looked for, this must be an E.
So these must be T and H.
This… could be an I.
So that might be an N.
Back to the book title: Terran… Cooking.
It's a cooking guide for Terran cooking.
Is that for the cooking of my previous life?! This is an unexpected find!

“I don't think this details any magic. But can I borrow this?”

“You can keep it if you like,” Lady Aenwyn says, “I just haven't gotten to disposing of it, anyway.
One of my predecessors spent their whole life researching on it.
I've never heard what they found out.
There's no real incentive of decoding that tome anymore.
I think it's just a meaningless thing to make people waste time trying to decipher it so they don't research greater magic for warfare.”

I finished decoding the title.
It says: “How to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with Cratherion Ingredients”.
It looks like the previous otherworlder was also fond of cooking.
Should I tell them about it? Let's keep it to myself for now.
I should also ask the gods about other otherworlders the next time I see them.

“In that case, thanks, I'll gladly take it off your hands,” I answer.
I put the book into my Infinite Storage.

“Just don't waste too much time decoding it,” she warns me.

I won't waste time. It won't be a waste of time.
I'm not looking for hidden meanings. What I need is in the text.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>The Second Day At Tatilans Castle</h1>
After lunch, we're back to Matt's office. Kat looks quite pale. Matt doesn't look that good either.

“Was it that bad?” I ask.

“I don't want to talk about it,” Matt answers, “I feel a little better after throwing up…”

“My bad,” I answer.

“Prince Matthew and Lady Katherine have been like that since Ms. Luket as eaten alive by a Big Slime,” Luna expressionlessly says.

Hearing that, Kat throws up into a bucket.

“Urghh!”

“Luna… please be more considerate!” Patrick says.

“I will try not to mention the dissolving of the convict again,” she answers.

Kat throws up again. So Luna is the person to go to if I need hard, objective opinions.

“Patrick, can you prepare the documents with Alexander?
I can't stomach to think about it right now,” Matt asks, “he goes by Alexander Kale now.
The former head of the house Luket made a fuss and tried to pin the blame on Alexander.
As a result, Alexander cut all ties to house Luket before the execution of his ex-wife.
His children have all come of age already, so there's no problem on that end.

There's just one problem: it seems all people of that house are hardcore Hume supremacists…”

“Are they under supervision?” Patrick asks.

“No, even if they were to defect to another country, it's no loss. Alexander is on our side.
Supervision would be a waste of resources.”

“I'll draw up the documents with him then.”

“Thanks, he should arrive soon.”

Patrick leaves the room.

“How was your second day at Tatilans Castle?” Matt asks.

“I'm progressing fast with learning how to read.
Though I'm more interested in the book Patrick gave me.
Apparently, it's in an Ancient script,” I answer.

“Oh, that book!
Can you read its contents?”

“Not really.
I'll have a look at it at some other time.”

“How's far have you gotten with writing?”

“I haven't even started with that yet.”

Matt gets a book from a shelf.

“Take this.
It has the order on how to write the different characters.
That way you can practise while you're in the forest.”

“Thanks, I haven't thought about it until now.
How about you get our future party to my place next time?”

“Sure, I was actually planning on that this week, but that turned out differently.”

“At least we can pick up our order from the armour shop tomorrow.”

“Yes, I'm looking forward to that.”

“You've ordered something?” Kat asks.
She starting to look better.

“Yes, it's something to commemorate our first monster subjugation,” Matt explains.

“Oh, you haven't had yours yet? What did you kill?” for some reason, Kat is all interested.

“A Giant Rabbit, the one from the revelation last week.”

“Wait, you were on the real subjugation?”

“Yes, why?”

“Mine was caught for me.
And all that I had to do was kill it.
My father told me that's how children of the nobility do it.”

“That feels like cheating…” Matt says.

“My first one was also caught for me,” Luna says.

Patrick enters with Alexander.

“Hey, we're done.
We just need your signature,” Patrick says.

“I'll read over it,” Matt takes the document and reads it.

“We were just talking about our first subjugation.
Apparently, some people get their first monster caught for them,” I inform Patrick and Alexander.

“It's a practice some wealthy houses do,” Alexander explains, “it all depends on the person who holds the item.
If they think that's a good charm it should be okay.
Some people that got their first subjugation caught for them have another made after slaying a monster themselves without the help of others.”

“Everything is fine,” Matt signs the document, “where should the farm be?”

“I'm thinking of the outside the capital, to the west,” Alexander answers, “I'd need to source some Slimes as well after the farm is built.”

“I'll share some of my Slimes at that time.”

“We'll keep in contact.
Till next time.”

Alexander leaves.

Patrick sits next to me.

“The days have been quite busy…
I could go for a dip in a nice hot bath,” Matt says.

“Is there one here?” I ask.

“Yes, it should be free now,” Matt answers.

“I'm going to hit the bath, too,” Kat says.

“Let's go then.”

As expected, it's gender-separated baths.

“Maybe I should get some separators installed in my bath…” I mumble while getting undressed.

“Couldn't just build a second one next to it?” Matt asks.

“I could do that, too,” I answer, “I'll see what I can do.”

We enter the bath.

“The bath feels so nice, *purr*.”

“I agree, *purr*,” Patrick answers.

“Come to think of it, I've never heard Pat purr,” Matt says.

“Most high-born Ailuranthropes think it's above them to purr,” he answers, “I've decided to show more of my feline side when we're amongst our group.
It's kinda sad how many high born Ailuranthropes are so ashamed of their feline side.
As if they're ashamed of being born an Ailuranthrope.”

“And the reason you only do that when we're amongst ourselves is?” I ask.

“It would be bad for Matt's image if I did that publicly now.
You don't need to change since you're the keeper.
Maybe people will start changing the way they think.
After all, you've been chosen by the gods to become the keeper.”

“Is that what people think?” I ask.

“Yes, that's what they think,” Matt answers.

“I see…”

“I still think this bath can't compare to yours”, Matt changes the topic, “I can't put my finger on what's different.
But your bath is much more relaxing and energizing…”

“That sure sounds great.
I really want to see it,” Patrick says.

I want to show him immediately, but Matt signals me not to do so.
So it's going to be a surprise for next week then.

<h1>Tales of Maple Wine</h1>
The next day, Matt and I go to Glorindamli's amour shop in town.

“Good morning!”

“Good morning, Glorindamli!”

“Good morning, Matt, Swift! You're here for your Prime Subjugation Charm. Let me get that for you!”

Glorindamli walks to the back of the store.

“What did you do? He usually is quite reserved towards new people!” Matt asks.

“Nothing much, I just sold him some stuff,” I answer.

Glorindamli comes back.
There's another dwarf with him.
Glorindamli hands Matt and me a dagger.
Mine is tinted dark green, while Matt's one is tinted dark red.

“It's a multi-purpose dagger made from the claw of that Giant Rabbit.
If you maintain it well, it'll last you a lifetime.
And this…” he hands me a bundle, “This is a sleeping bag made from the fur.”

“Just for me?” I ask.

“Well, as an Ailuranthrope Neotes you won't be growing much anymore so we can just give you high-quality stuff without worrying about you growing out of it,” Matt explains.

“Thanks,” I answer.
I can feel my face turning red.
I didn't expect this!
Sure, I knew he was up to something, but I didn't expect to yield all the fur for a sleeping bag for me.

I inspect the sleeping bag.
The inside is made of the fur; the outside is a fabric.
It feels water-repelling, like it's made of synthetic fibre.

“This fabric…”

“It's interesting, isn't it?
It used to be a tent that has been imported from abroad.
Someone accidentally cut the fabric so reused the fabric in this sleeping bag,” Glorindamli explains, “it was a good idea to bring that fabric here, Snakkonlir.”

“So that's what you used it for!” the other dwarf answers, “didn't I sell you that ages ago?”

“This fellow is Snakkonlir, he's a travelling merchant.
That Ailuranthrope lad is Swift, the one we talked about,” Glorindamli introduces us.

“Pleased to meet you,” I answer.

“So you're the one who made that Maple Wine!” Snakkonlir exclaims.

“Oh, you tried it? How was it?”

“It was great, especially for your first batch!
It's not as strong as it could be, but it was still good!
When are you going to make the next batch?
I'd like to buy more!”

“Soon, I guess, but the fermentation takes a while.
When are you here in town next time?
I can keep some in my Infinite Storage for you until you can get it.”

“That'd be great! Please don't forget it.”

“I won't, don't worry.”

I make a note: ‘Save Maple Wine for Snakkonlir’.

“Thanks a lot.
I need to leave soon.
Thanks for introducing us! Bye!” Snakkonlir leaves the store.

“That went better than expected!” Glorindamli says, “I just gave him a bottle to taste before you guys came in.
Now I want to taste is myself.
I guess I'll do that after today's work.
Can you sign here please, Matt?
I'll send the bill to the palace later.”

Matt signs the bill while I put my stuff into my Infinite Storage.
Glorindamli sees us off, and we return to the castle.
In the office, only Patrick is waiting along with a middle-aged man.
He looks just an older version of Matt.

“You must be Swift Mittens, the Keeper of the Crystal Down I heard so much about,” he greets me, “as you can guess, I'm Matt's father, Timon Sitnalta.
There's no need for big formalities here.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.”

“It's a pleasure to meet you, your Majesty,” I answer.

“What brings you here, father?” Matt asks.

“I heard you'd be receiving your Prime Subjugation Charm today.
And since it's my day off, I wanted to see what you got,” his father answers.

“We both got an all-purpose knife,” Matt answers and shows him his knife.

“It sure is a good knife.”

Matt turns to me and whispers: “Do you still have some of that Maple Wine?”

“I still have some bottles left.
You want a taste?” I answer.

“Yes, I think father would enjoy it as well.
It's your first meeting, after all.
Patrick, can you get us some cups for the four of us?”

“Sure,” Patrick leaves and returns a minute later with four cups, “what do you need them for?”

I take out some bottles of Maple Wine.

“This is some Maple Wine I made in the forest.
I hope it's to your taste,” I pour some wine into the cups.

Flynn appears out of thin air.

*«Former Master has brought tasty water!»*

Faryl and Felix appear as well.

*«Tasty Water! Tasty Water!»*

“Get a bowl as well, the Bunnyflies like alcohol.”

“As you know, Matt's Bunnyfly is called Flynn.
These two here are Faryl and Felix.”

Patrick gets a bowl and I pour some Maple Wine for the Bunnyflies as well.
They enjoy the wine.
Matt's father says: “There's no need to test it for poison.”

He takes his cup.
So do we.

“Cheers!”

We clink glasses and drink.

“It's good!” Matt exclaims, “no wonder the dwarfs are so keen on getting more of it.”

“You're exaggerating,” I protest.

“No, I agree with Matt, it’s fantastic,” Patrick says.

We look at Matt's father.
He looks as if he's thinking of something.

“Is something amiss, father?” Matt asks.

“No, everything is alright.
This wine is excellent.
That I can say, but yet it somehow feels incomplete,” he says.

“The dwarf did say it could be stronger.
Maybe I can let it ferment a little longer,” I answer, “other than that, I don't know if there's something else I can do to improve it.
I was just experimenting with making wine, anyway.
I did not expect it to such a hit.
I'll keep on experimenting.”

“I see… Maybe one day you'll find what's missing.”

I hear knocking on the door.

“It's me, Katherine,” I hear her say.

Matt nods.
Patrick opens the door for her.

“Oh, your majesty, you're here!” she says upon entering.
Luna is with her.

“Yes, I wanted to see Matt's Prime Subjugation Charm,” he answers.

“Oh, I want to see as well, can I?”

“Of course,” Matt answers, “it's this all-purpose knife!
Swift got a similar one.”

“I see, maybe when we start adventuring, I should get one too.”

“Why not now?” I ask.

“High society can be exhausting at times.
As a noblewoman, I'm not supposed to buy all-purpose knives.
I only get to buy an ornate dagger to defend my ‘honour’, if I'm to even buy one myself at all…
Or I'm supposed to just take up the sword…” she sighs, “I'm looking forward to going adventuring with you.
It means I can be free of this nonsense for a while.”

Matt's father starts laughing.

“You're right.
As an adventurer, you don't have the luxury of thinking of what high society might say.
You need to able to contribute to the party and be able to defend yourself at all times.
Overly ornate daggers aren't helpful in that regard.

I think I've been intruding here for too much.
I hope to meet you again, Swift.”

“I do hope the opportunity arises,” I answer.
Since when did I have that phrase in my language repertoire?
I guess I'm just letting myself go with the flow too much again.

“Till next time, goodbye!”

“Till next time, goodbye!”

Matt's father leaves the room.
Matt turns to me and grins.

“So, how was it like meeting my father?”

“He's very lax,” I answer, “I think I should be leaving as well.
I've been away from the forest for too long.
Will you be coming next week?”

“Yes, that time I'll take my future party with me.
Plus one member of the guard, for formality's sake.”

“I see.”

Matt and his company escort me to the city gate and see me off.

“Till next week. Bye!”

“Bye!”

<h1>Making Sashimi and Gathering Fern</h1>
Arriving at my cave, it's time to fully decipher that book.
Luckily, my notes don't have an upper limit on the content.
I've already forgotten the cipher I used before.
I should have written it into my notes when before I went to sleep yesterday!
I'm still not used to my skills…

I start deciphering the book from scratch again.
In this case, it's harder since I might remember something from my attempts yesterday.
But those could also be from the failed guesses I had too.
So I need to ignore anything that comes to my mind that's not a result of any deduction.

It feels as if this takes hours…
But I finally have the cipher, again.
Now I can just translate the book into my notes.
It's mindless typing, so I'll put it off for now.

I go to the kitchen and start cooking.
I didn't get any seaweed or any replacement, so I'm making Sashimi for now.
I take several of the Sky Salmons and use magic to freeze them.
If I can cool them down to cold enough, it should kill any possible parasites.

*“Absolute Zero!”*

The fish is immediately frozen solid.
Cloudy smoke flows from the fish to the ground.
There's no blueish liquid, so there's no need to worry about oxygen explosions.
I leave the fish to slowly thaw.
While waiting I'm making rice.
It feels like forever since I made rice without I rice cooker.
Rice cookers were so convenient!
While the pot with rice and water is heating up, I cut up some Barrots and put them into vinegar.
The water is boiling so, I turn down the heat by moving the pot further away from the fire.

After a bell, I start cutting the Sky Salmon and put some rice into a bowl.
I cut some Barrots too.
I put the Barrot green on a plate and let the Bunnyflies eat.
And I finally start eating myself.
The Sashimi tastes as I expected.
Soy sauce would be really nice!

After eating, I store everything I have over in my Infinite Storage.
And start transcribing the book letter for letter with the cipher I have.
It's quite a lot of text.
I need to spread this over multiple days.
After I'm done for the day, I go to the bath in the Evergreen Forest.
Purr, a hot bath after sitting around for hours feels nice.
I continue transcribing the next days.
After a few days, I'm finally done.
I read the notes.

The book — “How to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with Cratherion Ingredients” — is very detailed.
After stating the name of the replacement ingredient, it describes where said ingredient can be found and how it needs to be processed to get the desired taste or effect.

I look up seaweed.
Nice, I can use Futo Leaves for that.
They even grow in the Southern part of Avan Forest!
I can go there after Matt's group is gone.
I still need to make an additional room for Katherine and Luna.

I create another room in no time at all.
Next is creating a separate second bath in the Evergreen Forest.
Since I'm already here, I lead my Slimes into the Magic Space to have them create Fertilizer.
Those Slimes have evolved into Fertilizer Slimes.
Using Earth Magic, I mix the fertilizer into the soil and I again speed up the growth of the trees by another month or two using Forest Magic.

I check the health of the trees, and they seem to do fine.
The Tarry and Wooberry cultivation experiment is going well.

After that, I create a second bath and a wall separating the two.
The bath is about half the size of the other bath.
Since the wall is just a visual cover, it's relatively thin.
I also add some walls to the front so you can't be seen while undressing if someone were to be coming in from the entrance.
Some shelves for putting in your clothes would be nice too.
So I add those, too.

Since I'm finally done, I take a bath like I do every day.
Purr… So Matt's group should be coming the day after tomorrow…
I think I can go gathering Futo Leaves tomorrow.
I hope they are big enough so I can use them as I'm used to with Nori.

The next day, I go to the southern parts of the forest.
I try finding trees I'm unfamiliar with.
I analyze them, but I can't seem to find any Futo.
Have they gone extinct?

My Bunnyflies are with me.
For some reason, they just keep gathering around certain ferns.

*«What's up, Faryl, Felix?»*, I ask.

*«We found tasty plants!»* they answer.

I pick a leaf and taste it. Yuck! It's bitter!

*«Are you sure?»*, I ask, «It's bitter…»*

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Feno
&gt;
&gt; It's harmless to eat.
&gt; Despite the plant tasting bitter, Bunnyflies still like eating it.
&gt; In fact, they even love it.
&gt;

It's bitter, but yet it feels so nostalgic.
I wonder why…
But since the Butterflies seem to like it; I gather some and put it into my Infinite Storage.
Then it hit me: what if Futo aren't trees?
They could be ferns or shrubs!

I scan my surroundings again.
Finally, I find what I've been looking for: red ferns.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Futo
&gt;
&gt; Futo leaves are edible.
&gt; They grow everywhere, provided the needed humidity.
&gt; They are rarely used in cooking.
&gt; But they are said to be healthy, especially for Ailuranthropes.

Healthy for especially for Ailuranthropes?
That's a welcome surprise!
I collect some Futo leaves.
After gathering enough to make multiple servings of Sushi, I make my way back to my cave.

I'll postpone the Sushi cooking until tomorrow when Matt and the others come.
I think some of them might be averse to eating raw fish, so I take a detour and hunt a boar.

After bringing it back to my cave, I start preparing it so I can cook it tomorrow.
After waiting for my Blood Slimes draining the blood, I start dismantling it.
Dismantling is so much easier with the knife Glorindamli made for me!

I put all the things I harvested into my Infinite Storage and give the rest to the Slimes to eat.
Most of the evolved Slimes aren't interested in the entrails, only the unevolved ones and the Fertilizer Slimes are.
None of the Slimes seem hungry, so I don't need to find extra food for them.

It's been a busy day, I take a nice hot bath in the Evergreen Forest and get to bed.

<h1>A Short Chapter Where (Almost) Nothing Happens</h1>
“Sigh…” I hear Pat sighing. Again.
He seems to feel down today, too.
He's been like that the last two days.
I'm finished with my documents for today.
Kat's and my lessons about our foreign relations are about to start soon.

“Pat, would you please deliver these finished documents?” I ask.

“Yes, sure,” he mindlessly answers.
He takes the documents and leaves the room. Silence.

“Is something the matter with Pat?” I ask the others, “He's been like that the last two days!”

“Patrick has been different?” Luna answers, “I noticed he sighs a lot more in the last two days…
His performance is the same as always.”

Luna is as emotionless as always.

“He already behaved differently when he first brought in Swift,” Kat answers, “I guess he hasn't even realized it yet…”

Realize what?

“Swift? I guess he did have some influence on Pat…
But what do you mean by he hasn't realized it?”, I ask.

“What…”, Kat shakes her head, “I'm talking about him falling in love with Swift!”

“Wait? Really?” I answer, “Pat falling in love? That's hard to imagine!
I mean, he usually is all about professionalism and high society… Oh, I see what you mean…”

I've never heard him complain about Ailuranthrope high society before.
He only started that when Swift was around a few days ago…

“Two males falling in love is not helping towards the ultimate goal of creating offspring,” Luna says, “I suggest finding them suitable partners.”

“I don't think that's an issue here,” I answer.

“What about Swift?” I ask.

“He just got to know him, so probably thinks that's just how Pat is. So I don't think he noticed it.”

She's right.

“Should we tell him?”

“No, don't,” Kat denies, “it's none of our business.
Unless they do something that gets them into trouble, of course.
Pat sure has been acting differently, but he still does his work properly.”

There must be something we can do…

“Is there nothing we can do?” I ask.

“Let Pat take care of Swift whenever Swift is here!”

“Yes, that's easy. And what else?”

“And… nothing else. Maybe protect them from Pat's parents.
They might come and protest about ‘how unbecoming for high society’ Swift behaves.
You must have heard rumours about how his parents can be.
I wonder how things will develop between the two of them…”

“I've only heard rumours.
But what would they be asking?
As the keeper, Swift is a state guest.
And we certainly can't have Pat not be present every single time Swift is around!

And if they were to remove him from here, it'd signal to disqualify Ailuranthropes for lots of state positions altogether…
They should know that!
If they ever come and complain, I'll just tell them we'll have Pat teach Swift about Ailuranthrope High Society etiquette.”

At that moment, Patrick storms in. He seems to be in distress.
He's shaking.

“What happened, Pat?” I ask him.

“My parents sent mail…”, he answers.

“Where's the problem with that?”

“They are coming for a visit soon…”

“Again, where's the problem with that?”

“Both of my parents!
Both of them!
They never do that!
They don't get along! At all!
The only reason why they'd do that is they want to talk about my marriage!
I'm not ready for that!”

“Are you certain it's about marriage?”

“Yes, as I said, my parents rarely get along.
They only go together whenever it is needed they act as a couple.”

“In any case, have guest rooms prepared for them. When will they be arriving?”

<h1>Lesson in Lock Picking</h1>
I wake up at about {% include ruby base="7:30" text="half past seven" %}.
I should still have some time until Matt's group arrives.
I stay in bed and continue sleeping.
A while later I wake up.
It's {% include ruby base="8:4X" text="eight bells four-do-el" %} I should get up.
I still feel sleepy — maybe a hot bath will wake me up.
I make my way to the bath and reach out to the plug so I can fill the tub.
At least, that's what I'm trying to do as I get a burst of hot water into my face.

Well, at least now I'm awake…
I look down at the direction where the water came from.
The Hot Springs Slimes are there.
They radiate a feeling of panic.
What happened?
The Slimes slowly move out of the way.
I can see one of them looks as if something has bitten off part of it.
Did I accidentally step on one of them?

*«I'm sorry, I'll be more careful! Are you OK?»*

I carefully caress the damaged Slime.
Besides the damage, it seems to be alright.
I could be imagining it, but I think it's already filling up the missing part.
The Slimes finally calm down.
After bathing, I get dressed and leave the cave and wait for Matt's group.
They're not here yet.
Shortly after {% include ruby base="X:00" text="ten bells" %}, they arrive.

“Good morning, everyone!
Welcome to my place,” I greet everyone.

As expected, Matt has Kat, Pat and Luna with him.
There's also Alexander and Silas with them.

“Good morning, Swift!” Matt greets me, “you're awake!”

“Yes, I am,” I answer, “at least, I am now.
I almost crushed one of my Slimes while being half-asleep.
Good thing the other Slimes stopped me before it got critical!”

“Oh no! Is it terribly hurt?” Kat asks.

“It's good now.”

I call the Hot Springs Slimes over.
There's no Slime with visible damage anymore.
So it did recover!
But there's one that is notably smaller than the others.

“I think the smaller one is the one I stepped on.
Am I right?”

As an answer, it gently spouts water around.

“I'm glad you're alright.
Let's go inside so you can prepare your rooms.”

“By the way,” Matt hands me a package, “here's some paper and tools to practice writing.
And some books, too.
Among those, there's a copy of the Encyclopedia Magicka.
I heard you were interested in that.”

My own copy of the Encyclopedia Magicka? Neat!

“Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.”

We go into the cave and I show them around.
While the others are preparing their rooms, I unpack the package and put the contents into my Infinite Storage.

“Isn't it too dark in here?” Kat asks.

“I don't mind it that much,” I answer, “besides, there's this.”

I open the lid to my Light Crystal in the wall.

“There's a crystal as a light source in the wall.
Oh… it seems I completely forgot to look for another one for the new room.
I'll add that later.”

“It's OK, I'm not a diva!
Though I'd really appreciate that.
Though I have to say, this light feels nice.
Unlike typical magic light, it feels completely natural.”

“I know this glow!” Matt interjects, “didn't I get the Light Magic Skill from one of those?!”

“Yes, you did,” I answer, “I've put this one into the cave before you turned up the first time.”

“You can move them?”

“Yes, it's easy.”

“Stop, we don't want to hear it!
There's no need to spill your secrets as the keeper!” Matt stops me.

“Those crystals are said to be immovable!” Kat explains.

“I think I should read up on the myths of the world…”

“You really should,” Matt answers, “there should be enough material in the library.
But enough of that. Let's start training!
Unless there another hunt we have to take care of…”

“Haha! What are the odds of that happening?”

Silence. I don't receive a message. That's great!

“Don't you think the birds are quite noisy?” Kat asks.

“Are you sure? I think it's just because we're here in the forest,” Matt answers.

“No, now that you mention it, they are noisier than usual.
I think it'll rain soon,” I answer, “do you guys have rainproof clothes?
There's something I want to check during the rain.”

“Yes, we do. What are you planning?” Matt asks.

“Something special,” I answer grinning, “You can look forward to it.”

Silence.
Even the birds have fallen silent.
After a short moment, it starts pouring.
Even in the cave, you can hear the rain quite loudly and clearly.

“Well, so much about training today…” Silas sighs, “Well, I have something for you.”

He gives me a bag. I open the bag and have a look inside. There are bits of metal inside.

“What are these?” I ask.

“Those are lock picks,” he answers.
Upon seeing my confusion, he continues: “Other uses aside.
It's quite a handy skill for dungeons.
Some treasure chests there are locked.”

He takes out a padlock and a key and hands them to me. He also puts several other items on the table.

“Here's a lock for you to practise. I've more if the others want to have a shot at a lesson lock picking.”

“No, I'm fine,” the girls answer.

“I'm too old for that business,” Alexander answers.
He and the girls start talking about various things.
Matt and Pat on the other hand are very open to trying it out.

I examine the lock.
It's a simple design.
Silas takes out another pair and demonstrates how to use the picks.

“This is a very basic design, I mean a cheap copy of one.
It's basically just an illusion of a lock.
Sadly, there are some people that sell this.
All you need to do is turn the mechanism.
It's useless as a real lock, but it's a great tool to illustrate the process.

The ones I gave you are real ones.
They have some wards for more security.
But still, all you need to do is turn the mechanism.
It's just more fiddly.”

I take a pick and fiddle around with the lock a bit.
After several seconds, I manage to open the padlock.

“Like this?”

“Yes, like that.
Let's take it up a notch.”

Silas gives me another padlock.

“Hmm, this is harder than it looks,” Matt says.

“Oh, I think I broke the pick,” Pat shows us a completely bent piece of metal.

Instead of picking the lock I just got from Silas, I pick up a sturdy-looking box Silas put on the table.
It looks somewhat like a safe.
But it seems like it's made of very thin metal.
If it were thick metal, there wouldn't be any space inside.

“And what's this?” I ask.

“It's a lock-picking challenge that's being distributed by a locksmith in the capital,” Silas answers, “the locksmith promises a prize to whoever can open these.
The boxes are sturdy since they're made from Mithril.
The contents of the vials inside decompose if someone forcefully melts through the metal.”

“Are there any other restrictions?”

“No, but this is still way too hard for you.”

“Let me try something I have an idea…”

I imagine the lock opening.
All that needs to happen is the lock mechanism to turn.

*“Unlock!”*

I can hear a click.
I open the door of the safe.
There are two vials that touch the walls, connected by a stone contraption.
The stone looks like a very brittle mineral.
The contraption is exactly the size, so it doesn't bump around in the safe when transporting it.
The walls of the safe are a little thicker than I assumed, but still not even half as thick as I would expect from a safe.
I look at Silas. He shakes his head.

“I've heard of magic that can pick locks, but I've never seen it.
Where did you learn that?”

“I just tried it out.
I didn't know if it would work.”

“You should meet the locksmith and demonstrate the spell,” Silas whispers, “I can't wait to see his face when you show that to him.”

“Sure, why not?” I whisper back.

“I think I should be saying something about this,” Matt interjects, “So let's keep it at this: don't introduce him to unsavoury folks.”

“Don't worry, that person is very reputable.”

“I have to take your word for it…”

<h1>Hot Spring After a Trip in the Rain</h1>
A while later, the rain has noticeably calmed down.

“I think we should move soon,” I tell the others.

“Where are we going to?” Kat asks.

“The forest, somewhere in the southern parts,” I answer, “I can't guarantee it, but if you're lucky, you get to see something special.”

“If Swift says it's something special, it must be something truly special!” Matt jokes.

The group puts on their rainwear and we leave the cave.
We walk through the forest to the southern parts of the forest.
There's nothing at the location where I found the Sky Salmon.
We continue strolling around.
Eventually, we encounter a school of tuna flying in the air near the ground.

“Sky Tuna?!” even Luna seems to seem shocked.

“So it's Sky Tuna this time…” I mumble.

“This time?!” Katherine asks.

“Why are you disappointed?!
It's Sky Fish!” Matt asks, “They are rarely ever seen!
I've never seen any kind of those…”

“Neither have I…” Luna adds.

“So this is where you got them…” Patrick mumbles.

“Yes, last time, I encountered a school of Sky Salmon.
I'm not such a fan of tuna…” I mutter.

I think a dozen or so should be plenty.
Let's shoot only a few at a time.

*“Laser! Laser! Laser! Laser!”*

The hit fish drop to the ground.
Again, it smells like burnt flesh.
I collect them into my Infinite Storage.

“That should be enough for all of us.
Besides, I still have some Sky Salmon from last time.”

“Don't you usually need a reinforced net to catch these?” Silas asks.

“That's what I've heard,” Alexander answers, “I've heard Swift is somewhat special.
But I didn't think he's that special…”

“That's also some unusual magic you used!
Was that Fire Magic?” Patrick asks.

“No, it's Light Magic,” I answer.

“Light Magic? Light Magic is capable of something like this?!”

“With a few tricks, yes.
To be honest, it's more theory than trickery…”

I wonder if he'd understand it if I try to explain it…

“Can you teach me that spell later?!” Pat is very excited — his ears are twitching.
Oh, right! He thought Light Magic would be unsuitable for attacking purposes…

“Hmm… I'll try, but I'm not sure if I can explain it properly…
So don't expect too much!”

“Anything would be great!”

“Patrick! Please calm down!”

“Oh… sorry.
I got a little excited there,” he glances to the side and apologizes.

“Don't worry about it.
It's not like I can't understand why.
Let's go back!”

We return to the cave.
I don't know about the others, but after that trip in the rain, I'm freezing.

“It's good to be somewhere warm again!” Matt says, “but do you know what's best after a trip in the cold rain?”

“Of course!” I answer with a big grin, “a hot bath!”

I guess Matt feels the same as I do.

“*Gate: Evergreen Forest!*”, I open a portal to my Magic Space, “since I knew Kat and Luna would be coming, I've added the second bath in the Evergreen Forest.
I also added changing rooms.
We can enjoy this artificial hot spring all at the same time!”

“That's nice…” Kat answers, “but don't you dare peek!”

Everyone but me goes to their room and gets some change of clothes.
As they return, we enter my Magic Space.

Silas looks around, “the trees have grown.
It seems the plants are growing well.
Do you still use magic to speed up their growth?”

“Yes, I do.
Though, I'm taking it slowly.
I only make them grow a bit after adding more fertilizer to the soil.
I can feel the trees are healthy.
So I think it's the right approach.”

“This is… an orchard surrounded by trees?” Alexander exclaims, “you called it Evergreen Forest — it's a very appropriate name.”

We split up, go to the changing area, undress and enter the bath.

“Ahh… This feels nice!” Pat exclaims.

“This bath feels even better than the one the palace, don't you agree?” Matt says.

“I concur,” I hear Kat answering, “this feels more invigorating than the bath at the palace.”

“Is it alright not to have someone on watch duty?” Alexander asks.

“Sain said it's OK.
Apparently, Magic Spaces can't be entered without the explicit trust of the owner.”

“So the only danger is being ambushed when leaving the space?”

“Yes, but I'm sure they will be able to manage.”

“So basically, we should bring our gear here as well, just to be sure,” Matt adds.

“That'd be best,” Alexander answers.

“Though if you have the money to spare, you could also just have a spare set of gear stored here,” I add, “that or give them to me so I can put them in my Infinite Storage.”

“Oh, right, you do have Infinite Storage…” Matt answers, “having you with us makes things so easy.
It feels like cheating…”

“If you do feel like that why don't adjust your aims accordingly?” Alexander suggests.

“Your aims?”, I ask.

“Usually, I would just aim to get a Gold rank,” Matt explains, “Maybe we should aim for Mithril…”

“Gold? Mithril?”

“Oh, right, you didn't receive an explanation on how guild ranks work.”

“Let me explain then,” Alexander adds, “there are {% include ruby number="1X" %} ranks.
The lowest rank is Bronze-{% include ruby number="X" %}.
From there, you promote through Bronze-{% include ruby number="10" %} up to Bronze-5.
After that, you promote through Silver-4 up to Silver-1.
After that, the ranks are Gold-1 to Gold-3.
And after that, the ranks are Mithril-4 to Mithril-6 to Orihalcum-7 to Orihalcum-{% include ruby number="E" %}, then finally, there's Black-{% include ruby number="10" %}.
Orihalcum and higher ranks are very rarely ever issued.
The reason the numbers meet in the middle is starting with Gold ranks, adventurers are considered having a stable income.

Usually, royals that become adventurers for a while when coming of age, aim for a Gold rank to prove they can make a stable income as an adventurer.
But there is no rule that says it has to be the goal, you can always aim lower or higher.”

“I see…”

So ignoring the numbers, the ranks go from Bronze to Silver to Gold to Mithril to Orihalcum and then to Black.

After soaking in the bath for a while, we return to the cave.

“I forgot to ask, but are you okay with eating raw fish?” I ask.

“Raw fish? Isn't that risky?
Sometimes people become ill after eating raw fish,” Kat answers, “though I've heard there are some people who like to eat it that way…”

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Rice and Real Rice</h1>
“Well, there are some precautions you can do to make it safer. Watch!”

I take out some Sky Tuna and Sky Salmon.
I carefully descale the tuna — I've already descaled the salmon several days ago — and cut the fish to workable chunks and put them on a tray.
Now I cool them down enough to kill any possible parasites.

*“Absolute Zero!”*

Like before, the fish is immediately frozen solid.
Cloudy smoke flows from the fish to the ground.

“By freezing it fish to a very low temperature, even colder than ice, you can make raw fish food safe for eating as is.
It's so cold it looks like it's steaming hot.
But you should be able to sense it's cold,” I explain, “there is only one thing: if blue glowing liquid forms, you need to keep it away from fire and sparks…
In any case, we leave the fish to slowly thaw for now.
Meanwhile, we can prepare the other ingredients.”

“Just like that?” Kat asks.

“Just like that.
Though I'm not sure how to explain it so you can properly imagine the temperature needed for that.”

I have had unsatisfactory experiences with cooking too much rice in one single pot before.
Usually, the bottom portion is burnt while the central portion is still raw.
So in order to avoid that, I cook the rice in two pots.
I get the Futo leaves from my Infinite Storage.

“Oh damn, I forgot to preprocess them,” I mumble to myself, “whatever…”

I cut the Futo leaves into strips and arrange them overlapping each other on the table to form a single big sheet.
Now I just need to remove the water content.

*“Parch!”*

I can sense the water in the Futo leaves dissipate.
I think I can continue draining the water, but then it might become too brittle to use…
Anyway, I cut the big Futo sheet to sheets of usable size.
While I was taking care of the Futo leaves, the rice has already finished.
I put it on a lower flame to let the aroma develop.
The smell of freshly cooked rice fills the kitchen.

“Oh, that smells nice,” Matt enters the kitchen with the others from our party, “I've never smelled something like this before.”

“I think this is the smell of cooked rice, Prince Matthew,” Luna answers.

“Rice? I've never eaten that.”

“You haven't? Is rice considered too low-class food?” I ask.

“No, that's not it,” Matt answers, “it's just not many people around here know how to properly prepare it.
It usually ends up tasteless and odourless.
So the palace chefs never bother using it.”

“I've never experienced the smell of rice this intensive,” Pat adds, “how did you cook it?”

“How? I simply put it into a pot with water and cook it.”

“And then?”

“And then, nothing…”

“You don't drain the water?”

“Why would I do that?” I shake my head, “That'd remove all the flavour!”

I'm shocked… Silas and Alexander look into the kitchen.

“But what about impurities in the rice?” Alexander asks.
Silas and Alexander are standing in the doorway.
It seems like they were listening to our conversation.

“You rinse the rice before putting in the water to cook it,” I answer.

“So I've been doing it wrong all the time…” Alexander mumbles.
He claps with hands, “I learned something new!”

“Wait… you usually cook it in a lot of water then drain the water?!”

That how you cook dried pasta…
And rice definitely isn't pasta!!

“Yes, that's how many people cook rice.
It's not exactly a staple food.
But it's cheap, so people use it.
Nobody has ever questioned that method before…”

“I see…”

Oh my… what else is going to be different?
Maybe their tea is something like herbs that have been brewed in hot water?

I get the pots off the oven and take one of the pots and put in some fruit juice and some vinegar.
Rice vinegar would be better, but I've no idea how to actually make that.
I mix in the contents of the pot thoroughly.
After that, I put the pot into the fridge… at least that's what I planned.

I forgot to make a fridge…
I'm getting absentminded…
This is very unusual!
I'm not much of a scatterbrain.
Granted, I was when I was young, I'd lose my head if it wasn't fixed to the body, but nowadays I'd like to think I've got my stuff somewhat sorted… Such much about my to do list…
Is my mind turning back to that of a kid as well?
Anyway, I need to cool the rice.
Using *Absolute Zero* is probably overkill…

“Kat, can you try to freeze this with the spell I showed you?”

“Sure… So colder than even ice…” Kat answers, *“Absolute Zero!”*

The pot freezes — I can feel the cold.
But it's not as cold as it would liquefy air.

“Hmm, that's still too warm…
Well, I half expected that.
But it's just what I need.”

“I can't really imagine how it's supposed to work…”

“Hmm… I'll try to think of something to explain…
But food comes first!”

I put the pot of frozen rice next to the tray of frozen fish.

“Now I need to wait for those to thaw.
I'm sorry it's taking a while…”

“Don't worry.
I know good food takes a while to make,” Matt answers, “though I can hardly wait.”

After a while, the fish and rice begin to thaw.
I get three plates and spread them on the table.
I take the fish and cut them to pieces of 3 different sizes.
One size, I leave as is.
And put them — the Sashimi — them on the first plate.
The second size put on a similar-sized portion of rice.
I put the resulting sushi on the second plate.
The last size I roll in the Futo leaves with rice.
I put the resulting the Maki Rolls on the last plate.

“This would be better with some soy sauce but it's done.”

“Soy sauce? Never heard of that before.”

“Let me think…” I quickly look up the soy sauce in *How to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with
Cratherion Ingredients*, “it's…”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>How to Improve on Maple Wine</h1>
“It's made from the sap of a shrub called Xitu.”

Awkward silence. Did I say something unusual again?

“What's the matter?” I ask.

“I… I've never heard of it,” Silas answers.

“Neither have I”, Alexander adds.

Again silence.

“But I have,” Pat finally breaks the silence.
Everyone turns their head towards Pat, “it's an ingredient you commonly find in Ganesqua.”

“Ganesqua… isn't your mother from there?” Kat asks.

“Yes, she is.
I'm surprised you remember.
Anyway, there are two different kinds of shrubs whose sap is used as a condiment.
They are both salty but taste somewhat different.
My mother tells me she prefers Numa.
It has a taste reminiscent of fish.
Though she refrains from eating it when she has to meet people the day after.
It gives you quite a smelly breath for a while.”

“Is it the smell of rotten fish? How long does the smell last?” I ask.

“No, it's more like rotten eggs. And you tend to have that smelly breath for about a day.”

The sap of that shrub sounds like quite like fish sauce.
But it sounds like it has the same smelly after effect as garlic.
Fish sauce with the smell of garlic.
I wonder if it has the taste of garlic, too?

“I see. So… can I buy these in the capital?”

“You want some? I don't know where to get it in the capital,” Alexander answers, “but I'd look for Snak.”

“A Snack?”

“No, Snak, the wandering Dwarven merchant.
They say he specializes in more exotic groceries.
He might carry it from time to time.
Though I don't know when he's in town next time.
I'm not exactly a regular…”

“Do you mean Snakkonlir by any chance?”

“Yes, that's him. I just can't pronounce those Dwarven names…
Do you already know him?”

“Yes, I do.
Glorindamli introduced him to me.
He wants to buy Maple Wine from me.”

“Oh, I see.
I take it that means that Maple Wine of yours is Dwarf-approved?”

“I don't know about approved.
I feel it's more like they're waiting for me to perfect it.
Come to think of it, I should make the next batch soon.
Anyway, let's eat!
The one dish consisting of fish only is called Sashimi.
The one with fish on top of rice is Sake Sushi.
And the ones wrapped in Futo leaves are Maki Rolls.”

We eat.
Considering I've been eyeballing and replacing ingredients left and right, the dishes actually taste as they should.
There's just a hint of maple sweetness from the vinegar but it's not overwhelming, so it adds a nice touch instead.

“This is delicious!” Alexander, Pat and Kat have barely taken a bite as they exclaim at the same time.

It's just Sashimi, Sushi and Maki Rolls! Nothing much to foodgasm about…

“This dish brings out the light tastes of the ingredients.
This is a pleasant sensation”, Luna calmly says.
She's as emotionless as ever.
Even though her reaction is more in line with the one I was expecting, it still feels to me like she's exaggerating.

“Hmm,” Silas and Matt nod with a smile of satisfaction.
They are awfully calm.
Too calm…

“It seems I was right to brace myself for something as delicious as this,” Matt adds, “even so, I'm surprised how good this is!”

“Yes, this is even better than the dish we got last time,” Silas responds.

“You're exaggerating…” I mumble.

I notice one of the Slimes crawling on the table.
I think this is the one that likes to drink wine.

“What's the matter? You want some wine?” I ask even though I know it will definitely not answer.
None of my Slimes have been answering in Telepathy until now.
Usually, they just act for an answer or convey some feeling.
The slime stretches out part of its body like a tentacle and grabs some Sashimi to eat.
I can feel it radiating happiness towards me.

“This is a first!
That one only joins me when I drink wine.
I've never seen it eat anything else.
It seems to like the Sashimi.
That being said: I guess this does go well with some wine.”

I get several bottles of Maple Wine as well as several cups from my Infinite Storage.

“Why don't we have a drink?” I ask.

Everybody present nods.
I pour a cup of wine for everyone, including the Slime.

“So this is the Maple Wine I was told about,” Alexander says.
He takes a sip, “it's good.
I hear you still find it lacking.”

“Yes, I do. But I can't put my finger on what exactly the problem is.”

“Hmm, how about… No, that's impossible to pull off!”

It seems Alexander has an idea.
But he's dismissing it right from the get-go.
I don't think it's worth pursuing.

“Please do elaborate!” Matt wants to know it, anyway, “wasn't it you who thought me dismissing ideas outright without sharing it with others it is not a good practice?
After all, there might be a way to do it after all!”

“You're right. Here's a thought: how about making ale instead of wine?”

“Ale?” I answer, “I see that might be an improvement.
Where's the problem with that?”

“For Ale, you'd need Huffin.
But that doesn't grow here. Krale Kingdom grows them.
But they're have prohibited the export of Huffin.
I wouldn't dare to try to smuggle it here.
Relations are already strained.”

Politics… Meh…
Good thing I'm sworn to neutrality.
But I'd be quite bothersome if a war was to break out.

“Don't worry about it,” Matt tries to calm me down.
He explains: “Neither Krale nor Sitnalta would be able to properly wage war.
Raising a sea fleet in an inland sea would be a waste of resources.
Instead, both sides have their observers posted.
There's only a ferry between the two countries.
That ferry is run by the Merchants' Guilds of both countries.
And climbing the mountains for an attack is way too dangerous!
The worst case is a trade war, and that's would just be an inconvenience to both sides at worst.
Not even that. It's not like we have a lot of trade at all with them at all.
As a matter of fact, the ferry service is unable to earn its own keep.
It's being subsidized by both countries.”

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Divine Problems Transcending Realms</h1>
“So is that…” I begin to ask.

“The reason for the strained relations?” Matt finishes my question, “no, it's not.
If that was all the relationship would be so much better!
It's a problem with their currently most influential religion: the Order of Light, they believe in the deity of Light, Nuh.
Just to clarify, believing in other deities is not the problem.
But they believe Glanuh is an evil corruption of their god, and they keep demanding us to ban the worship of Glanuh and adopt the worship of Nuh. Furthermore, they see Dark Magic as inherently evil and demand those that have a talent for it to be executed.”

So even in a world where gods openly influence the world, there are conflicts over religion…
That light sect sounds quite dangerous.

“As far as we know, the Order didn't have those extreme views before,” Alexander continues Matt's explanation, “there used to be another denomination in Krale, the Faith of Darkness.
They worship the Deity of Darkness, Glan.
Both churches existed without major problems for a long time.
There's the denomination we belong to, the Insight of Vision.
But they are close to nonexistent in Krale.
There were some scuffles, of course, but according to our intel they never outright declared the other party as evil.
Something changed when the Order of Light rose to power a few years ago and had the priests and followers of the Faith executed.
Lately, things have been strangely tranquil between the countries.
They say the heir to the Order has gone missing.”

“So Glan and Nuh. And Glanuh. Sounds like the duality of Light and Darkness,” I mumble.
Where did that come from? I can't recall ever hearing or reading about that!

“Duality? What are you talking about?” Matt asks.

“Light cannot exist without Darkness.
Just as Darkness cannot exist without Light.
If you look at Light and Darkness close enough, they're similar.
Minor details might differ, but it's more or less the same.
Also, you can't really choose one over the other.
We need light to be able to see.
But we also need darkness to able to see.”

It makes sense, but where am I pulling this knowledge from?
Is that part of my skill in Light and Dark Magic?!
That last part makes somewhat sense.
Without the absorption of light, everything would be the same bright white.
That aside, I'm interested in Glan and Nuh.
I wonder if my Mystic Eye of Knowledge has some info on them…

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Glan
&gt;
&gt; Glan is one of the two Subordinate Deity to Glanuh and twin to Nuh.
&gt; Glan primarily administrates the Night and all aspects of Dark Magic.
&gt; Their symbol is the moon.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Nuh
&gt;
&gt; Nuh is one of the two Subordinate Deity to Glanuh and twin to Glan.
&gt; Nuh primarily administrates the Day and all aspects of Light Magic.
&gt; Their symbol is the sun.

So they are subordinate deities.
I wonder if I'll ever get to meet them.

“But if Light and Darkness is more or less the same, doesn't that mean Light Magic and Dark Magic is similar too?” Pat asks.

Now, my feeling tells me it's possible, but it's also quite dangerous.

“Hmm, I haven't tried that.
But now that you mention it, it would make a lot of sense.
I'd have to do some experiments for that.
But those are better kept for when fewer people are around.”

“That makes sense.”

The rain finally stops. We're done eating.

“Thanks for the food! It's been great!”

*   *   *

In an endless white room, three people are sitting around a stone table.
They all wear a worried expression.

“So he has to have gotten used to living in this world,” the male Hume says.

“Yes, Taron, that seems to be the case,” the male Ailuranthrope answers.

“Still, what was Flux thinking reincarnating him without any reason?!
Sure, it's been a while since the last otherworlder.
But we don't particularly need one right now!
And then there's them giving out skills and traits like that?!
And in that number?!
We're lucky this one is so docile!” the female Neotes sighs.

“You're right, Clayah… But there is still a problem…” a robed figured enters.
Their features are hidden in the robe.
They take a seat at the table.
They barely audibly mumble, “a divine problem.
With that many skills… I foresee it will cross the threshold…”

“So you have noticed him already, Ukota?” Taron greets the arriving person, “how long do we have?
Not that I particularly care.
But still, he ought to enjoy his life while he still has it.
I mean, Flux went through the trouble of reincarnating him.”

“According to my estimate, several dozen years.
It'll take longer if he makes more familiars.”

“We could suggest him to get some more…” Clayah answers.

“Yes, please do that discreetly.
Also, give him some work to do!” Taron commands.

“As you wish, Taron.
What about something in Suscellu's Domain?
They seem to be a good fit.”

“I think I could say the same about anyone's domain.
But I sure could use a subordinate,” Suscellu answers.

“I did not expect you to agree to this readily.
You usually reject any candidate I suggest without even thinking about it,” Taron adds.

“I like this one.
The ones you usually suggest are way too uptight.
I can't see them enjoying a good cup of wine.”

“I just don't like drunkards.”

“Enjoying wine doesn't mean being a drunkard…”

“Yes, yes, we've had that argument before.
It's your domain, so do whatever you want.
So it shall be.”

“Since that is decided, there one more thing…”

“What is it?”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Enter Lecarvi the Bard</h1>
After Matt and the others left the forest, I take a walk to the southern part of the forest.
I want to make a new batch of Maple Wine before I go on the next trip to the capital.
I look for the tree I've tapped for maple sap.
After walking around for a half a bell, I finally find the tree.
But it's not only the tree I find.

There's a female Kouniklanthrope sitting there drinking the sap from a horn.
She has a flower bud in her hair.
Even though I'm in hiding as always it seems as she has noticed me approaching.
See adjusts her ears towards my direction.
But I'm basically moving silently!!
She shouldn't be able to pick up my presence.

“Good morning!” she calmly says, “did those belong to you?
It smelled so tasty I simply couldn't help myself.”

I show myself.
She jumps a little in surprise.
So does she have some skill or trait just like Matt that gives her the ability to guess by presence?
I mean, she was still surprised by me showing myself…

“Good morning.
Yes, that was mine…
It shouldn't matter that much if you just took a little.”

I quickly get a glance of her character info.

{% include character/window.md character="lecarvi-1-46" %}

Enhanced Intuition, so I guess it's not as good as Matt's Super Intuition.

“Well…” she answers as her ear droop down.
I don't like the sound of that, “… thing is… I kinda took a little too much.”

She shows me the empty bucket.
A little too much?!
There should have been at least half a pond of sap in there!
Did she drink it? Oh wait, she did. I sigh.
Then I notice the other empty buckets beside her.
I sigh even more heavily. This is unbelievable…

“I guess I have to come back in a few days.”

“You're not going to starve because of me, are you? Come, let me hunt something for you!”

“I don't need…” I try to politely reject her offer, but I'm interrupted.

“I mean I took your sap so at least I can do that.
Young boys like you need their meat!”

“Do whatever you want…” I give up.
I'm not good at dealing with so pushy people.
At least, this one is friendly.

About five minutes later, she has actually tracked down a boar.
Now I finally notice she doesn't have any weapons with her.
She only has something that looks like a guitar.

She charges towards the boar while grabbing her guitar at the neck.

*“Musical Strike!”*

She hits the boar on its head with the guitar.
The boar immediately falls down.
She has just beheaded the boar with that one hit!
Contrary to my expectation, the guitar is still in one piece.

“Wha… what was that?!” I stutter.

“Musical Strike? It's a bard technique.”

“I see… Is that how bards usually fight?”

“Well, this is my version of it.
Usually, my master used her instrument to launch arrows with that technique.
But I'm no good with shooting arrows, so I just give them a smack with my trusty mandolin instead.
The technique hardens the mandolin and its strings so they don't break.
I don't know about other bards.
I've never talked to other bards but my master.
They are all my competitors.
I don't care much about what they do.
I have my own style.
In both music and fighting.”

“I see.”

“You can bring this home to your family.”

“Thanks, but actually, I live by myself in the forest.
–y name is Swift, Swift Mittens.”

“I'm Lecarvi, Lecarvi the Bard.
You do? Isn't that dangerous?
Living alone in the forest?”

“Not really, I have a safe place.
And I can take care of myself.
I do go to the capital from time to time to trade.
That maple sap you annihilated is the basis for a product I manufacture.”

“I'm really sorry. But that product of yours sounds tasty.”

“Pardon?”

“It sounds tasty.
I mean, the basis for the product is that sap.
And that sap is tasty.
So the product must be tasty, too!”

“It's nothing special,” I answer.
Her ears are aimed at me and the flower in her hair is blooming.
That's odd…
I don't think I'm able to not talk about it, “It's Maple Wine.”

“Wine? That's a strange thing to make of it. Why not ale?”

“I don't have Huffin for that.”

“Huffin?
Yes, you can use that, but you can use something else, too.
Too bad I can't remember what it was.
I should have listened to what my mother taught me.”

“So there is something else I can use for making ale?”

“Yes, there is. Now I vaguely remember something.
Bunnyflies love that stuff.
You just need to dissolve it in water, there's no need to process it like Huffin.”

I remember the taste of the Feno fern.
Yes, now I know what it reminded me of.
Like she's just said, I can use that as a replacement for Huffin!

“I see…” I answer, “thanks for hunting this.
I'll take it.
Since I don't have any business in this part of the forest anymore, I'll just go home then. Goodbye!”

Before she can answer I jump on top of a tree and move away.
In case she can somewhat track me with her trait, I take a detour before getting home.
I think that's should be enough to shake her off.
Arriving at home, I grind one or two Feno leaves and open my last bottle of maple wine and in the Feno powder.
I then close the bottle again.
If this turns my wine into ale I should be done right?
I analyze the bottle.

&gt; Maple Ale (Young)
&gt;
&gt; This ale hasn't developed its beery taste yet.
&gt;

I'm quite sure this is not how you make ale.
I've got no idea how it works.
But if this is all to make ale, I'll just do it this way.
Since my plans of making more wine were foiled, I spend the rest of the day with getting some soil and fertilizer into my Magic Space.

<h1>Mortal Problems Transcending Realms</h1>
A bit later in the day, I go back to the maple trees to tap more trees.
I need to increase production.
But with what happened earlier, I need to make sure I have enough in case of some pests.
It'd be quite inconvenient if something like that were to happen again!

A few days later, I get the maple sap to make more ale.
This time, the buckets weren't annihilated by a stranger.
I doubt she would be able to drink all of them: I've tripled the number of taps.
I collect the full buckets into my Infinite Storage.
As before, I cook the sap down to concentrate the sap.
While the sap is shimmering, I grind the Feno to a fine powder.
After that, I fill the sap into containers together with yeast.
I add powdered Feno to 90% of all containers.
I still want to get some wine, after all.

I think I should get some kegs the next time I'm in town.
My containers are all made from glass.
They work, but I don't think I should sell the ale in glass containers.
Also, I think I heard somewhere brewing and ageing ale in casks can improve the taste?
Let's go to Tatilans for that.

As I'm about to exit the cave, I notice a Kouniklanthrope in the vicinity of the Crystal Down.
It's Lecarvi. What is she doing here?!
She hasn't looked in my direction, so I don't think she has noticed me yet.
Is there some magic I can use? Anything?!
Luckily, my skill suggests a spell to me.
I need to project a thought or an image on a barrier.

*«These are just some vines hanging from a solid cliff,»* is the thought I want to project.
I aim the spell at the vines that hide the entrance to my cave.

*“Concealing Barrier!”*, I whisper.

I can feel energy enveloping the cave entrance.
I think it worked.
I continue observing Lecarvi.
I can see her ears twitching.
Did she detect that spell? She walks away.
I heave a sigh in relief.
I think I'm safe.
I don't think she's a threat, but I sure don't want to deal with her right now.
I quickly leave for Tatilans.

{% scene_break %}

Somewhere in the old world, in a graveyard.
Several people are muttering things in unison.
Others are crying.
Two men are standing apart from the others, whispering to each other.

“The Bus Factor… Now it feels like we jinxed him. This feels bad..”

“Don't worry so much, Vash.
If he were here he'd say something like: ‘I owe you a smoothie.’”

“I know, Gunnar, I know.
But we're at a funeral.
It's improper to joke and laugh!”

“I'm sure he wouldn't mind.
But considering how his stuck up relatives seem to me, they might make a scene.
Now I get why he didn't have any qualms to relocate for this job at our place.
I mean, this place here is at the other end of the country!”

“I can't disagree.”

{% scene_break %}

Later, online in a voice chat.

“Has anyone seen Mittens lately?” a boy asks.

“Not really.
I haven't seen him online for weeks!
I haven't seen Kicks either,” the woman answers, “maybe…”

She is interrupted by a bell sound.

“Oh, it's Boots.
I was about to suggest you had eloped with Mittens.”

“But why would we need to elope?
We're already flatmates.
Well, former flatmates…
I just came from his funeral service,” the man that just arrived answers and sighs, “I finally made it back to the hotel.”

“A funeral?! What on earth happened?!”

“Mittens… Mittens got run over by a bus…”

“A bus, so he doesn't get isekai'd,”

Silence.

She quickly adds: “Oh sorry, that joke was quite tasteless of me.”

“No, it's okay. I don't mind.
If he was here he'd say something like ‘Bus, Truck. Where’s the difference?’”

“Yeah, he'd say: ‘It’s big and has more than four wheels!’” she giggles, “but on the more serious side: Why didn't you tell any of us about it?!
We would have attended!”

“No, it's better that you didn't.
His family is… Well, let's say they are very… conservative.
They don't want random people from the internet to turn up.
They were exhausting.
And now I need to look for a new flatmate I'm not looking forward to that…
Mittens used to tell horror stories of bad flatmates… I need to do that properly.”

“Couldn't you just have that place to yourself?”

“No, I'd have to look for another place for singles.
But a flat share for this place is just much cheaper!
Rents are quite pricey these days.
Especially for singles!
And I like the place I currently have.

You should have seen where Mittens used to live before we got this place!
It was more or less a cupboard on the fifth floor without an escalator.
And it was somewhere in the boonies!”

“Isn't your place in the boonies?”

“It's just half an hour commute.
And our place is much bigger and in much a better location!
And he had to pay double the price as he did for our place.”

“Oh no, this isn't great.
I'm not looking forward to moving out from my parents' place…”

“I remember when we were looking for a flat.
He suggested posing as a pair.
He said some landlords prefer pairs over 2 people flat-sharing.
Even though legally it's about the same.”

“Oh, really? I might try that!”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Dropping by Glorindamli's Armoury</h1>
On my way to Tatilans, I arrive at a farm.
Or rather, this construction site that looks like it's going to be a farm.
This certainly hasn't been here the last time I went to Tatilans.
The main house is barely done, but it looks like it's livable.

The door opens and Alexander and Pat come out to greet me.
That's a surprise.
So this is Alexander's new place?

“Hello, Alexander! Hello, Pat! How did you know I was coming?” I ask.

“I didn't. I was on my way to your place,” Pat answers, “Matt got Flynn to go with me for this.
Since it's on the way, I was just stopping here at Alexander's farm for a bit.
This is where he's planning to raise Slimes for the Slime Gelatine production.”

“As you can see, it's not done yet.
But when it's done, I'd like to get some Slimes from you.
After all, I still don't know if any Slime will do for that project.
From what I know, there's the possibility only your Slimes are capable of producing Slime Gelatine.”

“I see. Just take your time building this place.
The Slimes aren't going anywhere!” I answer.
I turn to Pat: “So what brings you here?”

“Matt needs to go on a smaller trip to the south.
Just a regular inspection of the area.
But it's still a bit away.
We figured you might want to join us.
If you're interested let's talk about the details in the palace.”

“Sure, I'm interested.
But before that, I need to drop by Glorindamli's place for a bit.”

“I see, let me accompany you.
Again, thanks for your hospitality, Alexander.”

“You're welcome. Goodbye!”

“Bye!!”

We leave the farm and make our way to Tatilans.
Seeing Pat being with me, the guard lets us enter Tatilans without any checks.
We continue to go to Glorindamli's Armoury.

“Say, Pat, have you tried archery yet?”

“Yes, it's going surprisingly well, I have to say.
It's a little tricky, but I seem to have the knack for it.
Also, Lady Aenwyn found some old documents detailing lost Light Magic.
You use your staff as a bow and shoot light arrows.
I managed to pull it off, but it doesn't look like what you used on the Sky Fish.”

“Light arrows?
That sounds more useful than my Laser spell.
Oh, we're already here.”

“I'll wait outside.”

I enter.

“Good afternoon, Glorindamli!”

“Good afternoon, Swift! It's good to see you.
You have some more pelt?”

“Yes, I do,” I take out the pelt from my Infinite Storage and hand it to him, “but I need some help, too.
It's about… this,” I give him the bottle with the young ale.

“The wine? Is there a problem?” Glorindamli asks.

“Kind of. Just go ahead and taste it. This a trial run for an improvement,” I grin.

“If you say so…” he opens the bottle and takes a sip.
His eyes open wide.
“This… isn't Maple Wine. THIS! This is ale! MAPLE ALE! It's still young ale but how did you…”

“Shh!” I try to calm him down, “that's a secret, for now at least.
I have started a batch, but I need some casks for this.”

Silence.

“My beard… I won't pry how you did it…

I see, casks for ageing ale…
Used casks are no good.
And existing residue would change the taste…
So new casks.
Hmm, I'll source you some casks.
It might take a while though.”

“You will?!”

“Yes, I'll just push the task onto Snakkonlir.
He'll manage it.
He'll be the one that'll profit most, so giving him more work shouldn't be a problem.

Before I forget: that other item Prince Matthew ordered for you is finally done.”

“The other item?”

“Didn't he tell you?
When he ordered that sleeping bag he also ordered a falconry glove made for you.
It just look a little longer, since I had to get the right material.
Since it's done, let me fit it for you.”

He hands me the glove.
I put it on.
It's a half glove made from sturdy leather, and it fits quite nicely.

“A perfect fit. So I hear you keep a very special bird?”

“No, it's just a hawk.
And keeping is saying too much.
He usually lives on his own in the forest.
He just joins me for hunting and food.
When we go hunting he tends to sit on my head, hanging onto my headband.”

“I see.
This should do.
Don't worry about payment for this.
It's already been taken care of.
If you have trouble with it don't hesitate to come here.
I'll have word sent to you when I hear about the casks.”

“Thanks for your help. Bye!”

“Don't mention it. Bye!”

Since we're done here, Pat and I make our way to Tatilans Castle.
In Matt's room, the others are already waiting for us.
Silas is there as well.

“I'm glad you could make it, Swift.”

“I hear you're going on a trip?”

“Yes, our group was tasked with a routine checkup of Cogen, a town three days south of here,” Luna answers in her usual emotionless manner.

“It's relatively safe, so apart from our party, only Silas will accompany us,” Kat adds.

“That's only what's on paper,” Matt adds in a more serious manner.
Silence fills the room.
“The accounting numbers we received from that town don't really add up.
There might be something fishy happening.”

“I see.
That's why it's Silas.
So I take it we're just there for the cover story of a routine checkup and Silas has the real work?”

“Yes, that's basically it,” Silas answers.
His answer isn't as carefree as I remember him.

“Is something amiss, Silas?” I ask.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Mail Mirrors and Message Bottles</h1>
“No, it's nothing. I just have a bad feeling about this whole thing.
Anyway, it's great you'll be accompanying us.”

“Well, I've been thinking… it'd be great there was a faster way of contacting each other.
I mean this time, it was a mere coincidence I was going to Tatilans, anyway.
And I happened to meet Pat on the way.”

“I see,” Matt answers, “It never occurred to me.
That would have been bad if you had missed each other.
Well, the easiest would be using Mail Mirrors.
All the guilds have those.
They use them to exchange letters with each other.
If it were just a matter of you living in another town, we could just use guilds' Mail Mirror service.
Those artifacts are really expensive, so there's no way we can afford a pair just for private communication.”

“You could use Message Bottles instead,” Silas suggests, “Mail Mirrors can be connected to a network.
Message Bottles can only be used as the pair you find them in dungeons.
And unlike Mail Mirrors, they are relatively common and affordable.”

“Message Bottles?” I ask.

“It'd be better to demonstrate them,” Matt answers, “Pat, would you please get a pair really quick?”

“Sure, I'll be right back.”

Patrick leaves the room.
We're waiting for him to return.
Meanwhile, Matt pours some wine for Flynn to drink.

“Thanks for going with Pat,” he says.

“You're doing a terrible job of hiding you have a bottle for emergencies,” Kat suddenly mumbles.

“So you found out?” Matt answers, pouting.

“Found out is saying too much.
It's a given you have one.
I'd be very surprised if you didn't have at least one.
You should have suggested Message Bottles in the first place.
Suggesting Mail Mirrors just makes like you're avoiding the subject,” Silas answers instead of Kat.

“I see what you mean.”

“Anyway, it's common practice to take any bottle your captives may have on them.
It's to make sure they can't communicate.
You could smash them, but in your case, I guess smashing it would make the castle send out a rescue party.”

“Why would the castle send out a rescue party?” I ask.

“If you destroy one of the bottles, the other one of the pair shatters, too,” Matt answers.

I hear someone knocking.

“Enter!” Matt answers.

Patrick is back.
He has two bottles with him.
They have a colourless liquid in them.
He hands them to Matt.

“As you can see, they are filled with water,” Matt explains.

He opens one of the bottles and pours out the water.
He puts the empty bottle on the table.
He then shows me the other bottle. It's empty, too.

“As soon as you put something in one of the bottles, you can see it in both.
It can be removed through either bottle.
A bottle filled with liquid can't transmit written messages.
But if you disguise it, you can send a limited range of messages by doing certain things.”

“The most common thing for upper-class people is the destruction of the bottle means ‘request for rescue',” Kat adds, “It's the same for my bottle.”

“I see,” I answer, “so if anything that goes in can be taken out from either bottle, what would happen if a living being would enter it?”

“Nothing, it doesn't turn up in the other bottle,” Silas answers, “noises don't get transferred, too.”

“Anyway, this bottle is for you,” Matt says while giving me one of the bottles, “I'll keep the other one.
I could have them taken care of by intelligence… but I'm sure you'd be more comfortable with me taking care of it directly.”

“Thanks for your consideration,” I answer.
I put the bottle into my Infinite Storage.
The next moment the bottle on the table shatters.
Shattering is exaggerating it.
It crumbled. Oh, damn it!

“I'm sorry, I didn't expect this to happen!”

“Neither did we.
So putting it into Infinite Storage breaks bottles…” Pat answers.
Over the table, I take the bottle from my Infinite Storage.
As I expected, the bottle breaks too.

“Shouldn't we clean this up?” I ask.

“No, it'll vanish within one hour,” Kat answers.

“I see.”

“I'll get you another pair,” Pat says as he leaves the room again.

Shortly after, Pat returns with a new pair.
Since I don't have a bag, Silas ties it with some robe to hang it from my belt.

“Now that's settled… we leave tomorrow?” I ask.

“Yes, that's the plan,” Matt answers.

“I need to prepare for the trip.
Let's meet at Alexander's Farm at {% include ruby base="09:00" text="nine bells" %}.”

“Let's do that!”

“I'll accompany you to the city gate,” Pat offers.

“Thanks. See you tomorrow! Bye!”

“See you tomorrow! Bye!”

As we reach the gate, Pat hands me a bundle.

“It's the clothes made from Magic Yarn.
I took the liberty to get them for you.”

“Thanks a lot.”

“You're welcome.”

“So see you tomorrow! Bye!”

“See you tomorrow! Bye!”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Alfred Jodocus Plumel</h1>
I've made my way back to the Forest.
I've barely entered the forest as get a really nasty feeling of cold coming down my spine.
Very nasty.
My mind tells me I should run away.
I guess that's my Danger Sense again.
I don't have the feeling it would kill me if I ignored it.
But I should run away, anyway.
Really fast.

Running away from whatever it is, I start jumping from tree to tree.
I perceive small animals fleeing the same way.
Looks like I'm running in the right direction.
We get to the river.
The animals climb up a tree and use the branches to flee to the other side of the river.
And what do I do now?!
I'm too heavy for those branches!
Oh right, I could try to use my Feline Form!
But the creature everyone is fleeing from is coming closer.
I can already see what it is.

It's a big spherical chick?!
It's spherical, very spherical.
Basically, a ball of fluff with a face on the front and wings at its sides.
It reminds me of a certain game featuring angry poultry.
And this one is about the same height as I am!
It's yellow, like a stylized chicken chick.
And it's angry!
At least I'm not a green pig that's been eating its eggs.
It's gotten quite close, so I have nowhere to run.
Out of other options, I observe it from above.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Gold Plumel
&gt;
&gt; While Plumel commonly used as mounts and pack animals are bred, this specimen grew in the wilderness…
&gt;

Before I can finish reading the glossary entry, the Plumel has already charged against the tree I'm currently standing on.
I lose my balance and fall off the tree.
I managed to land on the floor without any problem.
Anyway, the Plumel seems to have fainted from the collision.
I examine it closely and make sure it's not acting.
I notice it has an arrow stuck in what I assume what its left wing is.
Maybe this is the reason it's so angry!
Hopefully, it will calm down after I remove this.
I carefully remove the arrow and get back to reading the glossary entry.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Gold Plumel
&gt;
&gt; While Plumel commonly used as mounts and pack animals are bred, this specimen grew in the wilderness.
&gt; Wild Plumel are very hard to tame.
&gt; Gold Plumel are even harder to tame.
&gt; It is said they are much faster and untiring than other variants.
&gt; Like other Plumel, they prefer Tarry over any other fruit.
&gt;

Good thing I have some Tarry in Infinite Storage left.
I take out some and put it in front of the Plumel.
After a while, the Plumel wakes up.
It eyes the fruit.
Its gaze alternates between me and the Tarry.
After a while, it finally eats the fruits.
I think this bird is big enough for me to ride.
I imagine my energy gently touching and enveloping the Plumel.
I stretch my hand towards it.

As before, fine strings of light of all colours appear from my hand and circle around the Plumel.
They slowly approach it.
It continues eating.
Even as the strings touch it it's not retreating yet.
The strings of light form a ball around the Plumel.
The ball shakes several times.
After the shaking, the ball is seemingly absorbed by the Plumel.
Success!
I hear a sound effect again.

{:class="interface"}
&gt; Familiar Contract
&gt;
&gt; The contract with the male wild Gold Plumel was successfully made.\\
&gt; Give the Gold Plumel a name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\
&gt; <span class="btn btn-outline-primary active">OK</span> <span class="btn btn-outline-primary">Cancel</span>
&gt;

Hmm, what should I call you?
I'm so uncreative with naming things…
Chicken… No!
Again, I won't call it chicken!

After pondering for longer than I want to admit, I decide to call it Alfred, Alfred Jodocus Plumel, similar to a famous cartoon duckling in my childhood.
Even the only thing those two have in common is the chick yellow colour… and they're both poultry.

*«Your name shall be Alfred. I hope we get along.»*

*«Thanks, master. I'm sure we will.»*

Wow! He does sound like Alfred the cartoon duckling!

*«Please climb on. I'll bring you wherever you need to go.»*

*«Are you sure? Aren't you hurt?»*

*«It's already healed, thanks to master.»*

*«I see.»*

I climb onto Alfred and direct him to the cave.
It's kinda hard not to fall off.
But somehow I manage.
I might need a saddle…

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Cooking and Divine Banter</h1>
A while later, we arrive at the cave.
It seems the magic I used on the vines in front of the cave has already waned.
And immediately we encounter a problem: Alfred doesn't fit through the door —  I need to widen the entrance enough for Alfred to fit.
I climb down and touch the wall.

*“Grind!”*

There's no need to worry about the cold from outside seeping in.
The vines that hide the entrance do a good job of isolating warmth.
I should introduce Alfred to my other familiars.

*«Raiden, Faryl, Felix, come here!
I want to introduce you to a new friend.»*

Faryl and Felix immediately come from the bedroom.
A moment later Raiden flies in, too.
I try to have him land on my hand with the falconry glove.
He lands without any problems.

*«How is the glove, Raiden?»*

*«This is much better than landing on master's head.»*

*«This is Alfred!
Alfred, meet Raiden, Faryl and Felix.
Please get along!»*

I hear a ringing sound — it's another mail!
I open the mail.

{:.interface}
&gt; Mail\\
&gt; Sender: Suscellu\\
&gt; Subject: Next Meeting Tonight
&gt;
&gt; I know this is somewhat last minute, but the next meeting is tonight.
&gt; There will be more gods coming today.
&gt; See you tonight.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Suscellu
&gt;

There will be more gods tonight?
I guess I need more food then!
I have some boar on me.
I guess I'll make some Schnitzel then.
If I had some sparkling water, I could make Tonkatsu.
The only difference between Schnitzel and Tonkatsu is the fluffiness of the breading.
Maybe what you have on the side counts as well…

Anyway, I have some leeway in my finances and stock-keeping so I make my breading from Panko, crushed dried bread without bread crusts to get it more fluffy.
I still fry them in a pan, though.
I'll bother with deep-frying when I can get my hands on some fizzy water.
This time, the Schnitzel end up more fluffy, but they're still not anywhere as fluffy enough for me to call them Tonkatsu.

Fruit Jelly is perfect as it is now.
I might be able to improve it with some vanilla sauce.
Do they even consume milk in this world?
If yes, can I consume it?
I mean, this is a new body!
So the lactose intolerance of my old body won't affect me, will it?
I don't have any vanilla on me, so I make the Fruit Jelly like before.
While waiting for the Jelly to set, I make some more fries.
On second thought, I want to be able to eat it cold too, so I'll make Croquettes instead.
I can just use the extra breadcrumbs I have from making Schnitzel.

As the Jelly has finished setting, I put everything into my Infinite Storage.
Time to go to bed!
When my consciousness returns I'm back in the while void where I met the gods the last time.

“Good evening!” I hear Suscellu's voice greeting me.
I turn around and only see Suscellu.
I wonder where the others are…

“Good evening! Am I too early?”

“No, you aren't — I just wanted to talk with you in private before the others arrive.
You see, you have been placed under my jurisdiction.
So I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
After all, there aren't that many people exclusively in my domain.”

“Not many people? How come? Aren't you the Deity of Nature and Wine?”

“I shouldn't tell you about the mortal problems, but this time I might as well tell you.
A few days ago, you were told about the Order of Light, weren't you?”

I nod.

“Well, in short, they didn't only kill the followers of the Faith.
They massacred followers of every other deity.
They even tried killing my followers, the folk that used to grow Huffin.
All of Krale was made to follow the Order.
Well, not entirely…
One small village of indomitable followers of Earth's Bounty holds out against that invasive religion.”

“Earth's Bounty?
Do they have a secret potion?
Like one that gives you superhuman strength?”

“Superhuman strength?
No, that potion doesn't to that.
Those potions are taboo, anyway.
However, if you use that secret potion after harvesting, plants will turn back to the budding stage.
If used correctly, you can double the yield of certain crops.
Not all plants can take advantage of that, of course.
That potion is a well-kept secret of the followers of Earth's Bounty.
It could be used to ruin the harvest, too.

The only reason they haven't been attacked yet is Krale currently valuing the high yield of crops that the village provides.
Though I fear that might change sometime soon.
And when that happens, we need to help, too.
Oh, by the way, the followers of Earth's Bounty both worship Clayah and me as their guardian deities.
They have a special connection to us so we can intervene more freely.
But if we intervene through you, there's nothing to worry about.”

“I see.
I don't know how I'm supposed to help.
But I'll do what I can.”

“For now, just get a few more familiars,” a female voice answers instead of Suscellu.
It's Clayah.
“Are you sure it's not going to a problem with telling him so much?”

“No, it's okay,” an unfamiliar voice answers.
It's a robed person.
I can't tell what race or gender they are.
“It's not a question of if there is a need for intervention, but when.
It's better for us if he knows about it so he can intervene for us,” They turn to me.

“How do you do?
I'm Ukota.
My domain is Time and Fate.”

“Pleased to meet you,” I really want to know how they look and so on…  but it's rude to ask!

“Aren't you going to ask?”

“Huh? No, it's rude.”

“Yes, I agree, it's rude.
The ones before you didn't think it's rude and blatantly asked.
I hated them.
I like your attitude.
I'll tell you: I don't have a form below this robe.
I just have this robe for the convenience of others.”

“Oh!
Looks like I made it on time!” another voice says.
It sounds like a young man.
I look in the direction of the voice.
It's a Dwarf with a beard and all.
I don't care much about beards, but hisbeard has some kind of awesome vibe to it.
He turns to me.
“Howdy! I'm Rhygni, the deity of Cooking and Forging.
Pleased to meet ya!
I heard you made delicious food, so I decided to drop by.”

“Pleased to meet you.”

“Since everyone is here, let's start!” Suscellu announces.

I take out the food from my Infinite Storage while Suscellu prepares some wine.

“This time, I have Schnitzel with Croquettes and Fruit Jelly.”

“Finally, we get to taste Schnitzel!”

“So these are Croquettes…”

“So this is the Fruit Jelly I have heard so much about…”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>What Is the Mad Cow Disease?</h1>
The next day, I wake up early.
I'm still not sure if it was a good idea for Ukota to teach me that spell…
*Ageing* — as the name suggests, it's a spell that accelerates time.
I can use it to age products.
But I was told it can also use it to age living beings!

Even though Ukota assured me other people wouldn't be powerful enough to age any living being I'm still somewhat concerned about what would happen if this spell were to accidentally spread.
The difference between fermentation and rotting is just if people can take advantage of the result.
Meaning the spell could be used to destroy lots of food!

While I'm happy to learn about methods to make more food, I'm not sure how I feel about its potential of using those methods to destroy food!
At the very least, I should consider those methods part of the secrets of the Keeper.
Being the Keeper has become a somewhat convenient excuse for me.
I have knowledge other people don't have — it's one of the Keeper's secrets.
I lack knowledge that people consider basic — that's normal.
The Keeper is a hermit.

I think I'll try out the spell later.
I need to get ready and go to Alexander's farm.
Faryl and Felix aren't comfortable with people, so I ask them if they want to join for the trip.
They decline.

*«That place is getting darker. We don't want to go there…»*

Again, I can't make much sense of it.
They're quite cryptic.
On the other hand, Raiden is quite happy to join me.
As I have four Slimes now that produce Slime Jelly, I take three of them with me.
I mount Alfred and we travel west towards Alexander's farm.

I arrive at Alexander's place.
Nobody is here yet.
I dismount and knock on the door.
Alexander opens and greets me.

“Good morning, Swift!
I didn't expect you to be here first.”

“Good morning, Alexander!
I just got up a little early.
I have the Jelly-producing Slimes with me.”

Alexander leads us to the closest Slime hutch.
I have the Slimes hop in and transfer the contract to Alexander.

*“Transfer Contract!”*

“This…
Thank you.
But I should tell you transferring contracts is something only some masters of Taming Magic can do.”

“It is?
So how else would you change the contract?”

“You release the contract and have the other party make their own contract.
It's not a big deal if only people you trust are around.
But do be careful.”

“Thanks for the advice.”

“It's the least I can offer.
I noticed you have quite a gorgeous Plumel.”

“That's Alfred.
I contracted him yesterday.
Riding on him works somehow.
But I think I should get a saddle.”

“Good thing I happen to have one.
You can have it.
One of my old acquaintances found out I got a farm here and they gave me a saddle.
I can't use it since it was made for Neotes to use.
It should be the perfect size for you.
Wait here.”

He goes somewhere and returns with the saddle.

“If you care about your familiar, you should regularly remove the saddle.”
Alexander shows me how to properly put it on and remove the saddle.
I practice it to make sure I can do it properly.
Matt's party arrives about half a bell later.
They ride on Plumels.
They even brought an extra one for me!

“Good morning!”

“Good morning, I see you brought a Plumel for me.
Thanks, but I've just contracted Alfred yesterday,” I pet Alfred.

“Kweh!”

“I see, we'll leave the extra one with Alexander then,” Matt answers.
He turns toward Alexander.
“Good morning, Alexander!”

“Good morning!
So I heard you're travelling.
May I inquire where are you headed?”

“We're going to Cogen.
It's just a routine checkup,” Matt answers.

“Cogen?
I see.
Silas is with you.
But still…”

“Is something amiss, Alexander?”

“One of my acquaintances told me Stirlea set up shop there.”

“Stirlea? He's Lady Aenwyn's predecessor, isn't he?”

“Yes, he is.
Andrew Stirlea, in his desperation to get results, he falsified data.
He got replaced by Lady Aenwyn, who proved his data and his results were bogus.
Apparently, people in Cogen started believing the nonsense he was fired for.
His latest thesis, no…
I have to say his latest conspiracy theory is: ‘The Mad Cow vaccine is just a ploy to weaken magic affinities of the villagers.’

That's so… nonsensical,” Alexander facepalms, “even the people at the castle regularly take it — the Mad Cow Crisis isn't something we want to repeat.”

“Mad Cow Crisis?” I ask.

“You are all too young to remember.
Several dozen years ago, there was a massive outbreak of Mad Cow Disease.
All domesticated bovine that contracted it started turning into rabid Minotaurs and started attacking everything they could see.

The army had to be mobilized to put down the rioting Minotaurs.
The army was able to quickly put a stop to the threat.
And there weren't many people injured.
But still, the effects were devastating.
The meat industry and the Mana surrounding the affected villages took years to recover!

It was determined to be a disease that spread from humans to cows.
Humans aren't affected by it.
But cows are.
Since cows couldn't be vaccinated, a vaccine was developed.
The crown and the temple covers the cost of manufacturing and distributing it to the people.”

“So there is a chance of that Mad Cow Disease breaking out in Cogen?!”

“It's not impossible.
We don't know what the source of the disease is.
The vaccine just stops the infection chain at a point we have knowledge about.”

“Alexander, can I have some paper and ink?” Matt asks.

“Sure. But why?”

“I'll request father to send some troops to ‘patrol the area’.”

“Are you sure?
It's just a slight possibility.”

“I was planning on taking Flynn with me on the trip.
But he insisted on going into Avan Forest to stay with Faryl and Felix.
He said something like…”

“‘That place is getting darker.’”, I interrupt Matt, “Faryl and Felix were the same.”

“I see.
It is said Bunnyflies are sensitive to Mana and presences.”
Alexander answers, “Given that I'd also assume it has already started…”

“I'm done.
Let's go,” Matt is ready to go.

“Are you sure?” I ask.
I mean, in the worst case, the village will turn into the Cow Level!

“You should be strong enough to handle a few of them,” Alexander answers, “Minotaurs are reckless.
If you can defend against their initial attack, they are defenceless.”

“I'm sure we'll manage,” Matt adds.

“If you say so.
Let's go.”

<h1>Robbery on Avan Highway</h1>
We ride South for several bells without meeting anyone else.
In the beginning, the Highway follows along the western edge of the Forest.
After a while, the lush green forest to our right turned into a stone cliff.

“Say, what's behind that cliff?” I ask.

“According to the map, it’s just undeveloped wasteland behind that cliff,” Matt answers, “even though there should be enough water in that area, the soil isn’t suitable for growing anything.
As for now, it’s not worth the money to try to dig a tunnel through it to develop it.”

We encounter a group of people.
They are quite a mixed bunch.
The biggest of them runs towards us, yelling: “That Plumel is our prey!
I demand you give it back!” He points at Alfred.
I glance at Matt.
He quickly shakes his head.

*«Alfred, stay calm!
Even if you know them.»*

«I don't know them.
I pushed the one who hurt me fell into the river and he died.»*

“Your prey?!
This is my precious familiar!” I answer with an angry voice.
I'm actually angry.
That guy just goes around demanding things that don't belong to him!
Don't you dare lay a finger on Alfred!

“As if I would mistake that yellow fur!”

“That's so conclusive!” Matt interjects, “Sure, Gold Plumel are very rare.
But we've been riding together from Tatilans.
There's no way this one is the one you were hunting.
Assuming, of course, you were actually hunting at all.”

“Matt!” Silas yells.
I can feel a sense of urgency in his voice.

“I know,” Matt answers calmly.

The other group draws their weapons and grin.
Several other people come out of hiding.
We're surrounded.
So this turned to a robbery?
Dang it.

*“Greater Fortify Armour!
Greater Resistance!
Greater Full Potential!
Greater Strength!
Greater Magic Boost!
Greater Accuracy!
Greater Speed!”* I immediately buff our party while grabbing my knives.
Yes, I know it's excessive.

“What the…” apparently surprised, one of the assailants steps back.

“He's just bluffing!
There's no way he can use all those high-level spells!” the man that demanded my Plumel yells.
You know, I actually can and did use those spells.
I learned them while reading the Encyclopedia Magicka Matt gave me a while ago.

*“Enchant Lightning!”*

I enchant my knives with electricity.
Pat told me there's no penalty for killing in self-defence.
But still, I don't like the thought of killing people.

*“Musical Strike!”*

It's a familiar voice.
All the people behind us are sent flying.
A cloud of dust rises where the men were standing.
I can barely see the outline of one single person holding a mandolin.
Yes, that's definitely Lecarvi!

“It looks like you're in need of some help.
I just happen to have taken a quest to take care of those robbers,” she says.

“Thanks, Lecarvi,” I answer.
The cloud starts to set and you can finally see her.

“Oh, it's Swift!
What are you doing here?” she finally notices me.
The flowers in her hair start blooming once more.

“Not now, there are still enemies around,” Silas cuts her off.

Thanks, Silas!
I'm just not good at dealing with her type.

*“Shield Bash!”*, meanwhile Matt already has gotten off this Plumel and charges in with his shield and hits two of people.
They stumble.

I jump off Alfred and slash them with my knives.
They collapse.
Huh? They're foaming in their mouth?
Did I put too much power into the enchantment?
Well, they're still alive.
I have a look at how the others are doing.

*“Air Shot!”*, Kat sends a person flying, “Wow, those buffs are really amazing!” Behind her, another person starts swinging his sword at her.

*“Refulgent Arrow!”* Pat shoots a light arrow.
He hits the sword out of the attacker's hand.
Luna immediately knocks him unconscious with the blunt side of her sword.

“Thanks, Pat, Luna.”

“Don't mention it,” Luna and Pat answer in unison.

“You're not half bad!” Lecarvi says.

“Thanks,” Luna answers.

*“Musical Strike!”* Lecarvi again sends the last two attackers against a nearby cliff.

“Thanks a lot for your help, Lecarvi.”

“Don't mention it, I got the quest to take care of them, anyway,” she answers.
She starts tying up the unconscious attackers using a rope.
I would have expected her to use vines instead.

“I should introduce you.
This is Lecarvi, Lecarvi the Bard.
These are Matt, Pat, Kat, Luna and Silas.”

“Nice to meet you!”

“Nice to meet you!”

“Nice to meet you…
So that's the infamous bard Lecarvi,” Silas mumbles.

Infamous? Never mind, I'll ask later.

Suddenly, I can hear a loud roaring noise.
I look up to where it comes from.
This isn't good…
A big chunk of the cliff has broken off and falling towards us.
What now?
I don't have any spells that might be any use for this.
I need to think…

*“Hyper Eccentric Ultra Great Giga Extreme… extra Hyper Amazing Punch!!”*

A dark-haired boy wearing a dark cape and a white headband jumps up out of nowhere and punches the boulder, pulverizing it in a fiery explosion.
He looks the same age as we are.
Is he a Neotes?

“You're late, Sobe!” Lecarvi complains.

“No, you're just way too early,” he cheekily answers.
“We weren't scheduled to meet for another bell.”

“That's Sobe, he's a battle nut,” Lecarvi halfheartedly introduces him.

“I just like fighting.
It's not like I can't think of other things but fighting,” he complains.

“Whatever you say.”

“So the robbers have already been taken care of without me.
Not that I care much.”

“We still need to transport them to Ise.”

“Yes, I know…
So…” he turns to us.
With him being closer now, I see he's about a head taller than I am.
“As you heard from Lecarvi, I'm Sobe, Sobe Tagun.
Pleased to meet you.”

I introduce the others to Lecarvi and Sobe.

“Since you're riding Plumel, I guess you're travelling.
What's your destination?” Sob asks.

“Cogen”, Matt answers.

“Cogen? That's South of here, right?
What a coincidence!
I was planning on going there too.
Why don't we go together?”

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>Who Needs Barrier Crystals?!</h1>
We slowly make our way towards Ise, the next village.
I thought having the prisoners would slow us down quite a lot.
But we're moving at the same pace as before.
And somehow, the prisoners seem quite afraid of Alfred.
So they're moving faster than I expected.

*«Did you do something to them, Alfred?»*

*«Nothing special, I just want to be scary so they don't touch me.»*

“Alfred seems to be able to use *Intimidation*,” Pat says.

“I figured as such,” I answer.

“But that doesn't explain why they are in such a hurry,” Kat says what I think.
“Not that I mind.
It just means we'll actually reach Ise today.”

“Maybe it's about that…” Sobe mumbles.

“That?” Matt, Pat, Kat and I ask.
As expected, Luna doesn't seem to be interested.

“I only know this by hearsay.
Several weeks ago, a wannabe tamer tried getting his hand on a rare Plumel.
His attempts for making contracts failed.
In his anger, he insulted the Plumel, which then kicked him in the nuts out of spite.
They say he was unconscious for several days.

I'm not a tamer, but isn't that common sense not to insult whatever you're trying to tame?
Anyway, I'd like to meet that Plumel.
It seems quite a good fit for me!”

We finally reach Ise.
As Lecarvi and Sobe need to take the prisoners to the prison, they recommend us to stay at the Kitten's Purr.
We promise to meet later.
They go with the guards.
Our group goes along the street.
Even though it's the late afternoon, some stalls are still open.

“Barrier crystals for sale!” an old man advertises his wares.

I stop and have a look at the said crystals.

{:.interface}
&gt; Item: Barrier Crystal
&gt;
&gt; A Mana Crystal enchanted with a spell that connects with other crystals with the same enchantment to form a barrier that is impenetrable by monsters.
&gt; Certain configurations make the barrier stronger.
&gt; This crystal can also be used individually, creating a short-time barrier around the user.
&gt;

Yes, those are barrier crystals, the same kind as I used before.

“Barrier Crystals make you impotent!” a nearby stranger yells.

“Are you sure?” I ask him, “Why would that be?”

“A recent study showed couples that use barrier crystals are less likely to have offspring the following months,” he answers.

“Of course they would have fewer offspring!” Matt answers, “people…”

“See?” he interrupts Matt, “Barrier Crystals make you impotent!
Save your money so you can pamper that stupidly shiny plumb bird of… Owww!”

Alfred went ahead and kicked him. In the nuts.
He holds his balls in pain and collapses.
I feel sorry for the vendor.
The other guy? Not so much.

“I'll take a dozen please,” I give an order.

“Sure. I'll give you some extra crystals as thanks to your Plumel.
That guy was getting annoying,” the vendor answers as he hands me the products,
“you see, Ise is the last town on the route I can sell those.
Over in Cogen they actually believe that nonsense that he spouts.
I just want to sell out so I have an excuse for not going to Cogen.”

The guards arrive and question the bystanders.
I can hear a nearby villager saying: “He insulted a Plumel. Again.
And yes, he spouted his usual conspiracy theories.
If he had a Barrier Crystal, he wouldn't be out now.”

The guards break out in laughter.
“You heard it. It's his own fault.”
They carry the unconscious man away without even questioning us.

“You mentioned Cogen,” Matt addresses the vendor.
“have you heard about other conspiracy theories going around in Cogen?”

“The biggest one is ‘The vaccine against the Mad Cow Disease is just a ploy to weaken magic affinities of the villagers.’
I have seen some villagers mixing the vaccine with powered magic crystals and selling it as Mana Potions.”

“How long have they been doing it?”

“It must be like several years now.
It's crazy!
The Mad Cow Crisis is barely one generation in the past!
Without the help of the followers of Nature's Bounty, we would have all starved!
I wouldn't be surprised if the crown were to ban cattle farming after the next outbreak.”

“You think there will be an outbreak soon?”

“Yes, just as last time, the animals and monsters are leaving the area.
When I was travelling from Farry, I noticed there were a lot of animals leaving.
There are still animals here in the area, so I think this town is safe.”

“Does the army know about that?”

“I don't know.
Even if I were to tell them.
Why would they listen to a random old man like me?”

“You'd be surprised. Anyway, thanks. Bye!”
Matt turns to the party.
“Let's go to the inn and check-in.”

We move to the inn.
I've been wondering: Why hasn't there been any announcements by the temples?
I hear a ringing sound — it's mail! I discreetly open the mail.

{:.interface}
&gt; Mail\\
&gt; Sender: &nbsp;Suscellu\\
&gt; Subject: Mad Cow Disease
&gt;
&gt; Since we're still debating I can't tell you much.
&gt; I'll tell you some historic things about it, instead.
&gt; The outbreak one generation ago was a biomagical weapon accident.
&gt; Thus it's something resulting from the actions of mortals.
&gt; Back then, we didn't intervene.
&gt;
&gt; All I can say is: listen to the elderly.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Suscellu
&gt;

We arrive at the inn and check-in.
I think I heard something about dinner being served soon.
Instead of going to the hall, Matt immediately drags us into his room upstairs and locks the door.
He places a crystal orb on the table and let's magic flow through it.
After a few seconds, the face of Timon, Matt's father, appears in the orb.

“It must be urgent if you use the orb.”

“I have reason to believe there will be a Mad Cow Disease outbreak in Cogen soon.”

“On what basis is this?”

“According to the peddler I questioned, Cogen seems not to have used the vaccine we provide for several years.
Animals and Monsters are leaving the area just like before the last outbreak.”

“Those are quite valid points.
But if something of a big scale like you think will happen.
Why haven't the gods sent us an oracle?”

“Pardon me interrupting,” I calmly start explaining.
“According to the knowledge I received as the Keeper, the gods consider the Mad Cow Disease a mortal-made biomagical weapon.
Thus, if it were to return, the gods are bound to neutrality and are not to act.
With that being said, I believe the peddler we talked to has a point.”

“Did you receive an oracle?” Matt asks.

“How did you…? I'm supposed to say no, you know?!” I answer with noticeable bad acting.

Timon gasps, “I… I'll send troops under the guise of training.”

Timon's face fades and the crystal shatters.

“I was about to tell him the oracle only contained historic information,” I continue.

“I don't think that changes anything,” Matt answers.

<h1>Banter At the Inn</h1>
“Silas, I've been meaning to ask what you meant by Lecarvi being infamous.”

“Oh, you heard that?” he answers.
“How do I say this… It's said her emotions can be very intense.
Apparently, she gets offended quite easily and tends to pick fights with other adventurers.
Though I hear she's never lost a duel.
After seeing her fight, I can imagine why.”

“I don't think she's a bad person,” I reply, “she's just somewhat hard to deal with.
From our previous meeting in Avan Forest, I reckon she reacts favourably towards an offering of good food.”

“You make it sound like she were a higher power,” Matt jokes.

“I just don't know how to deal with her.
All I can do is try to get her to leave as soon as possible.
At least she's not accusing me of crimes or yelling other nonsense,” I put on a wry grin.

“Please don't talk about that again,” Kat asks, shaking her head in horror, “I'm still trying to forget those events.”

“OK. I won't,” looks like she can't forget that horrid scene of the execution, “I'm sorry.”

“No, I'm sorry. It's just too much.”

“Anyway, let's go down, I think they are about to serve dinner.
I assume Lecarvi and Sobe will be arriving soon, too. I want to get to know Sobe better before we got with him to Cogen.”

“So do I,” Matt answers.

I open the door, lead the others downstairs into the hall.
There are still some open tables.
I walk over to one of them and look at the others.
They nod.
We sit down.
Not soon after, the door opens and I can see Sobe walking in.
I wave.
He sees us and immediately walks to our table.

“Hello again, Sobe. Wasn't Lecarvi with you?” I ask.

“Yes, she was, but she decided to leave town and go westward.
She said something about going further south and even staying here making her feeling uneasy,” he sits down, “that's just how she is.
That usually means something exciting will be happening soon.
That's why I want to go there tomorrow.
How about you?
Are you still planning on going?”

“Yes, we are,” Matt answers, “You're welcome to join us.”

“Neat. By the way, have you chosen what to have for dinner?
I can recommend the casserole.”

“We'll all have it then!”

“I'll take that as an order then.
Seven casseroles for table 4,” the landlady approaches our table.
“What do you want to drink?
I recommend the mead.
We can water it down if it's too strong.”

“I take watered mead,” Kat answers.

“Watered mead for me, as well,” Luna adds.

“I'll have watered mead, too,” Pat orders.

“I'll have regular mead,” Matt says.

“Watered mead for me,” Sobe asks.

“I'll have watered mead, too,” Silas asks.

“I'll have regular mead.”, I order.

So only two of us got regular mead?
The landlady brings us our drinks.
Matt pays for us.

“Cheers,” we clink glasses and drink.
It's tasty.
I just love mead.
This isn't as good as the mead I drunk with Suscellu.
This one is a tad too sweet, but it's still good.

A few minutes later, the landlady brings us the food.
It's a casserole no doubt.
The cheese crust on top has just the perfect level of caramelization.
I put a fork into my portion and get a bite.
Inside, it's pasta, meatballs and tomato sauce.

“Yes, this is really good!” I praise, “I should be making my special casserole sometime in the future.”

“You can cook?” Sobe asks.

“Yes, he can,” Matt answers in my stead, “It's quite a treat.”

“Oho? I want to taste it sometime.”

“Sure, if you ever drop by my place, I'll whip something special up for you”, I answer.

“But your place means…”, Matt interject.

“That just means in the worst case, someone has to guide him,” I answer with a grin.

“I see,” Matt answers, “I'm looking forward to it.”

“Is your place so hard to find? I don't think that will ever be a problem.
I have a knack for finding things. I'll just keep looking.
In the worst case, I'll have to ask Matt to guide me,” Sobe is full of confidence.

After eating, we go to our rooms.
It's been an exhausting day, so we drop into bed.
It's going to be a long day tomorrow.

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>The Cheese Crisis Breaks Out</h1>
The next day, I wake up to the noise coming from the street.
It sounds like quite a big commotion, so I go to the window to look outside.
People are running about.
And almost everyone is carrying at least one wheel of cheese.
I can even see someone carrying at least half a dozen around with their pushcart.
That's odd… I open the window.

“*Yawn!* What's up with the ruckus?
Is there a cheese festival today?”, I sleepily ask.
I recall hearing of some cheese rolling competition in my previous life.
Was it on the big island to the north?
I don't remember.

“A cheese festival?
I like the sound of that.
No, if there were one, I don't think they'd dare to have one right now,” a passerby stops and answers, “Haven't you heard?
The supply of cheese is dwindling.
Starting with the elderly, many are stocking up on cheese before it runs out.
So now it runs out even faster!”

He walks closer and starts talking in a low voice, “some even say the Mad Cow Disease is coming back!”

“Mad Cow Disease? Wasn't there a vaccine against it?”

“Yes, but according to a rumour, the villagers of the village to the south haven't been using it.
I believe they say it's a ploy to weaken the common people.
It's said they haven't been taking it for so long the disease is about to break out.

But it's just a rumour. I mean if something like that happens, wouldn't there be an oracle by the gods?”

“I see, thanks for your time. Weren't you about to go buying some cheese too?”

“Me? Don't worry about it!
I make cheese myself.
I don't like the prospect of buying cheese made by others.
With people like that guy over there…” he points to the shop across the street.

“No, sir, you've already gotten two loaves of cheese today!
I won't be selling you any more of it!
Other people have a need for cheese, too!”
I can hear someone yelling angrily from that store.
Wow, that cheese situation seems quite severe…

“I just sell the seconds,” he continues, “it's a win-win situation for me.
He shuts up and I get rid of the pushy customer. Plus, I get to sell the seconds!
This cheese panic is so nonsensical…
I don't get why everyone is buying ready-to-eat cheese…
If they're going to hoard it, anyway.
Why not just get young ones and let them ripen?”

“I agree. So young cheese isn't that sought after?”

“Not really. Anyway, I need to go. Bye!”

“Thanks for your time. Have a nice day. Bye!”
I close the windows again and look around.

I see Matt sitting on his bed.
He's wide awake.

“Good morning, Swift!” Matt greets me, “What's the matter outside?”

“Nothing much,” I answer, “just some excessive hoarding of cheese has broken out.
It'd be better not to try and get cheese for our provisions.
And it seems there are some rumours of an impending outbreak of the Mad Cow Disease.”

“Rumours?”

“Yes, just rumours, it's not a real panic yet.
I know we originally wanted to leave as soon as possible, but I think we should get breakfast before leaving.”

“I agree. We should act calmly.”

We get dressed and go downstairs.
The others are already there.
No one has brought their stuff yet.

“It seems we all got the same idea,” Kat smiles upon seeing us, “Landlady, we'd like to have breakfast after all.”

“You do?! Thank the gods!
Everyone has been cancelling breakfast due to these damn rumours…
It feels so bad to waste food!
Here, have your breakfast on the house.”

She brings us our breakfast.
It's fried eggs sunny side up with bread.
I take a bite, the egg yolk is barely still runny. Yes, this is perfect!

“Usually I'd offer you some cheese too, but…”

“Don't worry, *munch*, about it,” Sobe swallows his bite.

“He's right,” I back up Sobe's claim.

“Thanks, I'm very happy you think so,” the Landlady answers, “feel free to get seconds.”

An offer I'm not going to decline…
After eating, we pack up and get ready to leave towards Cogen.

<h1>The (Not Secret) Cow Level</h1>
The village hasn't come into sight yet, but Luna suddenly stops her Plumel.

“It has already begun. There's a big fire ahead…”, she explains.

I try smelling the air.
I can barely catch the smell of fire.

“I smell it too,” I answer, “though I can't tell how big it is.”

Pat nods.

“Let's hurry!”, Matt asks.

*“Greater Speed!”* I immediately buff our Plumel,
“maybe we shouldn't have eaten breakfast in Ise after all.”

“No, there's not much we can do about the outbreak. And a mass panic in Ise would make more problems,” Matt answers.

Not soon after the village comes into view, I can see people running towards us. They're being chased by Minotaurs. So the cow level begins…

“Help!”

*“Lesser Speed!”* I buff the fleeing villagers. Then I buff our group.
*“Greater Full Potential!
Greater Speed!
Greater Fortify Armour!
Greater Resistance!
Strength!
Magic Boost!
Accuracy!”*

Since that's done, I get my bow and quiver from my Infinite Storage.

*“Refulgent Arrow!”* Pat starts the fight by shooting a light arrow at the closest Minotaur.

A Minotaur charges towards Matt. Damn, that angle is not good at all. He should dodge!

*“Shield Bash!”* Matt instead deflects the charging Minotaur by not hitting it head on and sends it flying.

*“Amazing Punch!”* Sobe jumps off his Plumel and punches another one and sends it flying against the other one.

I analyze one of the Minotaurs.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Proto-Minotaur
&gt;
&gt; Unusually strong exposure to Mana changed this bovine into an artificial monster.
&gt; With its confusion over its radically changed body, it attacks anything in sight.
&gt; This creature is particularly weak against Ice Magic.
&gt;

“It seems they're weak against Ice Magic,” I announce.

*“Air Shot!”* Kat blows another Minotaur away, “that's not helpful. I don't know any offensive Ice Spells.”

“I might as well try this out,” I mumble.

I imagine shadows a gathering in the form of a ball in my hand.

*“Shadow Ball!”* I shoot the black sphere towards the last Minotaur.

The ball hits it and pushes it back a bit. After the impact, the Minotaur collapses.

“Looks like it's working as I thought it would.”

Just as I've read from the Encyclopedia Magicka, the spell absorbs the life force of any target it hits.

“I can see why you said Dark Magic is dangerous,” Pat says, “as far as I can see it didn't do much physical damage. But you killed it, anyway.”

“Yes, the spell absorbs life force.”

“*Pant*, thank you,” one of the villagers says. He's out of breath.

“How many people are still in the village?” Matt asks.

“A few dozen have taken refuge in Stirlea's house, the others I don't know. I think they fled to the other direction.”

“I see. You should get away from here. The army should be on its way.”

“Already? But it just broke out a few bells ago!”

“There were signs this would happen. Silas, can you check the state inside the village? But be careful!”

“Of course,” he answers and rides off.

“How long do you think it will be until the army arrives?” Kat asks.

“Probably another few bells,” Matt answers, “this is going to be a problem…”

{% scene_break leaves %}

After not even a bell, Silas returns.

“How is the situation?”, Matt asks.

“The village is completely destroyed.
There is only one building left.
It's heavily fortified.
The people inside should last a few days.
From the people that left the village, it seems only the group we save survived.

About the Minotaurs…”

“Prince Matthew, we're here!”, Silas's report is interrupted by Sain's voice.

“Sain! You're here!”, Matt answers.

“Just the vanguard. The main unit will arrive  tomorrow.”

“It's a good thing you're here.
Silas was telling us about the situation in the village.”

Silas repeats the information and continues his report.

“About the Minotaurs, It's at least two gross Minotaurs, if not even more.
It's definitely enough we have to worry about an advanced variant turning up.”

“Since the villagers in there will probably last till tomorrow let's set up camp and wait for the main force to arrive,” Matt decides,
“for tomorrow, we'll just have to assume an advanced variant has turned up.”

“Yes, that would be the best course of action.”

<h1>The Battle of Cogen</h1>
The next day, after the main unit arrives, we prepare to wipe out the Minotaur outbreak.

“Prince Matthew,” General Ritchie tries to convince me again, “you don't have to fight at the frontline.”

“Again, thank you very much for your concern, but I'm going, anyway.”

“But the danger…”

“… is manageable!” I interrupt her, “I trust my party.”

“In the worst case, there's still me,” Sobe announces proudly.

“Thanks, Sobe. It's good to have you with us.”

“Sobe? As in Sobe Tagun? The Mithril Rank Adventurer?!” General Ritchie is taken aback.

“Yes, that's me!” he cheekily answers.

“If… If he's with you, I'm sure you'll be safe,” General Ritchie leaves.
I sigh a breath of relief.

“She's way too stiff! How are you supposed to show guts if you get to safety every time it might get dangerous?”

“I agree, but… don't be too harsh on her, she just means well.
She's always had a sweet spot for me…
Sometimes, I do wonder why she favours me over my elder brother…”

I wish I could have convinced her even without Sobe being here.

{% scene_break leaves %}

{% assign base = "11,:,00" | split: ',' %}{% assign text = "do-one,,bells" | split: ',' %}
It's {% include ruby base=base text=text %}, just a bell after noon.
The attack starts.
We rush in with the army and start killing Minotaurs.
Our party is split into two groups: it's Sobe, Swift, Luna and me at the front while Pat and Kat stay behind.
Patrick and Luna are to concentrate more on healing and support.

*“Shield Bash!”* with Swift's Ice enchantments on our weapons, we seem to do more damage than yesterday.
Luna finishes off the Minotaur I just knocked back.

*“Shadow Ball!”* Swift keeps on attacking with his Dark Magic.

I see one different Minotaur.
It's not hard to spot: it's slightly taller and has a crown on its head.

“It's a Minotaur Queen,” Swift mutters.
There's just a problem: she surrounded by even more Minotaurs!
We might need to retreat.

*“Storm Wall!”* Kat buys us more time by slowing down the enemies.

*“Great Amazing Punch!”* Sobe shoots a beam towards the Minotaur Queen.
That's not a punch, Sobe!

“I'm off,” he says as he races towards the Minotaur Queen.

“*Greater Full Potential!*” Swift rebuffs Sobe before he gets out of his range, “good Luck!”

Sobe comments with a short “Thanks.”

We continue fighting the “regular” Minotaurs.
The number of Minotaurs doesn't seem to decrease at all…

*“Shield Bash!”* the Minotaur barely takes a step back.
This isn't good — my hits are losing their power!

*“Enchant Deep Freeze!”* Swift re-enchants my shield.
Didn't he use a different spell before?

“I think we need to step up the game,” he says.

“Thanks, Swift!” I answer, *“Shield Bash!”*

The Minotaur I thought I'd be sending flying back shatters instead.
Yes, this is a different, much more powerful enchantment!
We can do this!

We continue fighting.
But then, I spot another different Minotaur: with its height, it's towering over the others.
It also has something looking like a tiara on its head.

“Wicked villains!” it yells, “The Pretty Minotaur Soldier of Love and Justice, I am Sailor Moo-n! And in the name of the…”

*“Greater Shadow Ball!”* Swift hits it with a big ball of Dark Magic before she can even finish her speech.
She's instantly annihilated, leaving nothing behind.

“She was still talking, Swift,” I comment, glossing over the destructive magic.

“Was that against etiquette?
The last I want to do right now is listen to a long-winded speech of our enemy's!” For some reason, Swift is visibly annoyed by the enemy he just annihilated.
So even the keeper has his dislikes.
It'd be best not to ask him about it later…

Thinking more about him, I know he has a lot of Magic Skills, but his capacity still seems so unreal!
He's keeping us buffed and uses Attack Magic quite frequently.
How doesn't he run out of energy?
I'm glad to have him as my friend.
Well, I guess that's what you gain when you get chosen as the keeper.
If he had more experience, he alone would outclass Sobe.
That's why it's so important to keep the scheming nobles away from him, with both him being the keeper and him being my friend.

“Looks like Sobe is done as well,” he says while pointing over to Sobe. It seems he's back to his usual self.
All that is left to do now is just cleaning up the rest of the mob.
I hope no third advanced variant turns up.
Even if another one were to turn up, with Sobe and Swift being here I doubt they'd be a problem at all.

<h1>Cleaning Up the Mess</h1>
“Hmmph, it took you long enough to come here!” a haughty scholarly dressed man complains.
A quick glance at his character window confirms he's Andrew Stirlea, the guy who more or less is the reason for this whole mess.

“No, we're early!” Matt responds.

“And who are you, whelp? Don't you know who I am?!” he angrily retorts.

“It's easy to guess who you are.
You must be Andrew Stirlea.”

“*Sir*! Andrew Stirlea!”

“No, your rank was revoked when you were dismissed from your post.”

“What would a brat like you know about…”

–att interrupts him by calling out to General Ritchie!

“Oh, General Ritchie!
How big is the damage?”

“Prince Matthew!
I was about to confirm the damage with the mayor.
Good thing you've already found him!”

Stirlea and the man who accompanied him gulp for air upon hearing General Ritchie calling Matt “Prince”.
The other one must be the mayor.

“Oh, how rude of me.
I should properly introduce myself.
I'm Matthew Sitnalta, the second prince of Sitnalta.
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.”

“What brings his highness to Cogen?”, the elder nervously asks.

“Nothing much. We were just planning on checking up on the facilities.
Alas, that's not an option right now.”

“Just as the scout reported, the village is more or less completely destroyed, save for the house of Mr. Stirlea”, General Ritchie reports.

“I see.
Mr. Stirlea, even though you had been removed from your post years ago, I'd still like to hear your opinion on this.
Do you have any idea of how the Mad Cow Disease broke out?
I was under the impression the crown was distributing a vaccine…”

Oh, I see, Matt is putting the pressure on him.
After all, it was his conspiracy theories that started the whole mess!
Stirlea closes his eyes to think.

“I currently don't have any idea,” he answers quite soon.
I notice his eyes wandering for a short moment.
He's definitely lying.

“I see,” Matt replies, “I guess I have to advise the king to ban the cultivation of bovines altogether just to be on the safe side.”

“But your highness, isn't that going too far?!” the elder asks in horror.
I get why: this village doesn't have any crops.
It's all just pastures.
A ban would spell the end of this village.

“No, we were lucky the army happened to be in the general area when we got word of the outbreak…

Let's leave dealing with those people to Matt for now.
If I listen in any more, I'll eventually start laughing.
I'm more interested in that biomagical disease, anyway.
What can my Menu tell me?

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Mad Cow Disease
&gt;
&gt; An artificial self-replicating magic-circle.
&gt; It forcefully monsterfies domestic bovines to Minotaurs.
&gt; Ineffective against other domestic animals and bovine monsters.
&gt;

“Pat,” I whisper, “are there any other bovine monsters?”

“Sure, there are Bouffantbulls and Bomiles.
Bomiles leave quite an impression whenever you meet them.
They are quite adorable with their mostly pink body.
They have more detailed features too, but they like rolling around so much the blur of pink is generally all what you see.
Why do you ask?”

“I think the Mad Cow Disease doesn't affect Monsters.”

“Are you sure?”

“That'd be perfect if it worked!” the elder exclaims. Apparently he's been listening in.

Matt, Ritchie and Stirlea turn towards us.

“What would be perfect?” Matt asks.

I repeat the idea of cultivating bovine monsters.

“Isn't that dangerous?”, General Ritchie asks.

Just as I'm about to answer I notice a pink mass rolling towards us.
Noticing my gaze, the others look in the same direction.
I discreetly analyze the mass.

{:.interface}
&gt; Glossary: Bomile
&gt;
&gt; A bovine monster. All monsters of this type are female.
&gt; The milk it produces is sweet and very nutritious and can be used to heal the ill or weary.
&gt; The taste and nutrition of its milk improves with the quality of the pastures it lives in, and the taste itself changes with the season.
&gt;

It reminds me a lot of a bovine monster of a monster collecting game.
That creature was the bane of a lot of people.

“I'm sorry!” a young farmer shouts, “there's no need to worry.
My Bomile likes rolling around.
And since the attack broke the fences, it's roaming about.
But it's totally docile!
Just don't get caught in its rolling path!”

“That's Whitney. As you can see, she cultivates Bomiles,” the elder explains, “or at least she's trying to.”

“I can see it didn't turn into a Minotaur, so it's definitely a thought worth exploring.
But you said he's trying to cultivate them.
What is the problem?” Matt inquires.

“Getting meat and milk is no problem at all.
They're just like regular cows in that regard.
But I can't get the Bomile to reproduce,” Whitney dejectedly answers.

“Hmm, what other bovine monsters do you have?” Matt asks.

“Just Bomile.”

“But aren't Bomile all female?” I ask.

“That thought never occurred to me!” he answers, “but you're right, in the wild, Bouffantbulls are found in the same areas as Bomile.”

“Can you get the village to change to cultivating Bomile and Bouffantbulls?” Matt asks the elder, “If you can do that, I'm sure I can persuade my father to fund the endeavour.”

“Are you sure?!”, the elder asks.

“Yes, if this works, there would be no need for the vaccine anymore.
I've heard some people have raised concerns against the vaccine, anyway.”

“Yes, yes, it can be done,” the elder answers.
He's jumping on it quite fast.
I guess to him this beats an investigation into the vaccine distribution.

“Slaughtering Bomiles is a somewhat dangerous operation,” he explains, “but it's not much more dangerous than slaughtering regular cows.”

He turns towards me, “thank you, young one. Your insight will probably save this village!”

“Don't mention it, I just spoke my mind without thinking…”

Now there's only one problem left: Mr. Stirlea.

</section>

<section epub:type="chapter">
<h1>The Case of Andrew Stirlea</h1>
“Bomiles? Bouffantbulls?” Stirlea repeats in disgust,
“this is an outrage! My study clearly…”

“… was proven to be bogus,” I nonchalantly interrupt him, “I have to emphasize you were removed from your post and lost your title for that supposed ‘study’ of yours! Your successor repeated the study.
No link between monster meat and assault crime were found.”

“That stupid girl wouldn't find correlations even if you pointed at them.”

Whitney and her Bomile leave for their farm. She's shaking her head.

“You greatly exaggerate correlations of minuscule proportions and call those findings ‘results’,” I answer, “also your methods are backwards.
What you're doing is akin to proving the cause of rain is a wet street!”

How did he even become court mage?

“I see why you were removed from your post.
I believe you are still given chances to redeem yourself.
I should convince them to stop doing that…”

“Chances, what chances?
I would only have to write my name on it to get a paper rejected.
They nitpick over the smallest things!”

“I beg to differ! I wouldn't call systemic errors a small thing.
Did you ever read any explanation you got with the rejections?!”

“Who cares about methods? All I need are results!”

“With what you're doing, you're wasting time.
What the crown needs are reliable information.
Not some spectacular thesis that proves to be the result of biased data!”

“Anyway, I'm offended by you suggesting something outrageous as cultivating monsters in my presence!” he rams is walking cane into the ground.

“In the interest of this village,” the mayor interjects and puts a hand on Stirlea's shoulder, “I need to politely ask you to keep your reservations to yourself.
It's common sense adventurers eat monster meat and they don't suffer any side effects.”

Oh, the mayor is selling him out.
I guess I managed to convince him Stirlea's work is not to be trusted.

Instead of answering, Stirlea stares angrily at me.
Then he suddenly collapses to the ground.
I check for his heartbeat. There's none — he's dead.

“I didn't mean to anger him to death!” I exclaim.

“Matt,” Swift mutters. His face looks grim, “it's not your fault…”

He continues moving his mouth but doesn't speak.

“Are you sure?!” Silas asks.
He stares at Swift.
Swift closes his eyes.
He takes a deep breath and then shakes his head, “as the keeper of the Crystal Down, I'm not allowed to say anything on the circumstances of Mr. Andrew Stirlea's death.”

The only thing that binds the Keeper is political neutrality, so this is part of a scheme.
Stirlea was just killed using poison or magic.
Who killed him, and for what reason?

“Good, I shall refrain from asking you about it.”

“Thanks, Matt,” he doesn't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Instead, his eyes are fixed on the mayor's left hand.
Could it be?

“It's regrettable the old friend of my father died,” the mayor says.

He's trying to keep a regretful face, but his face shows he has some reservations against Stirlea.
I think he's sweating.
He's not pinning Stirlea's death on me.
Are those his sincere feelings?
No, my feeling tells me it's not.
Did he get rid of him to save his own hide?
No, that's not it either.

“It has been a couple of very stressful days.
I fear they added up to too much for his frail old heart.
At least, he won't need to witness the radical change need to save in this village.”

There it is!
He really wants to protect this village.
I can't really condone crimes right in front of me.
But he's trying so hard do save this place I'll let it slide this time.

“Yes, it is indeed regrettable he died from exhaustion due to the recent events,” I reply.

General Ritchie adds: “I fear we have to add his death to the toll of the outbreak of the Mad Cow Disease.”

She leaves for her tent.

“For the sake of this village, I'll let it slide this time,” I mumble, “you owe me one.”

“Donnell,” the mayors mutters and looks me in the eyes, “I didn't tell you anything.”

He then leaves.

“Let's go home!” I announce, “there's a lot of work to do when we get home.”

We look for Sobe and take our leave.

“I'll drop by at some other time,” Sobe answers.

“It was nice having you with us,” I answer.

<h1>A Shopping Tour in Tatilans</h1>
On the way back, we stop in Ise for the night.
We barely made it is before the gate closed.
Other than that, the trip was quite uneventful.
Of course, we're staying at the Kitten's Purr again.
This time, they're serving meatballs and pasta.

“Come to think of it,” I ask the landlady, “how do you make the ground meat for the meatballs?”

“That? We simply bought a tool for that.
A wandering Dwarf merchant sometimes has those in stock.”

“A wandering Dwarf merchant?
You don't happen to mean Snakkonlir by any chance?”

“Yes, that's his name!”

Somehow, I half expected it to be him.
Well, I'm wanting to buy Xitu and Numa from him.
Adding a meat grinder to the order isn't going to make a big difference.

“I guess I'll ask him the next time I see him.”

The next morning, Matt greets me with: “Good morning, sleepy kitten!
I have a message from the palace for you: Gromli has been asking for you.
You'd better come with us to Tatilans.”

“Yes, of course.”

After breakfast, we ride towards Tatilans.
We arrive at West Gate of Tatilans without anything notable happening.

“Prince Matthew, we were instructed to tell you Count Donnell was seeking an urgent audience with you.”

“Don't worry about us, Luna and I will be accompanying Swift,” Kat says.

“Then Pat and I will go to the castle and meet Count Donnell,” Matt and Pat immediately leave.

“I said accompanying you, but would you mind if we stopped somewhere else before going to Gromli's shop?”

“Not at all. Where to exactly?”

“It's a bakery. It's a quite new one. But rumours say they have some unique goods.”

Kat leads me to a shop.
The sign says “Petifor Barker Bakery”.
There aren't many people around.
We enter the shop.

“Welcome to the Petifor Barker Bakery!” a female Cynanthrope greets us.

I take a look around.
She doesn't have a lot of bread on the shelves.
The majority of food is cake and sweets.

I order several things to sample: some croissants and donuts.
They aren't filled, but they taste very good none the less.
She is skilled.
Too bad she doesn't have that many customers…

“Not what I'd expect from a bakery…” I say what's on my mind.

The host's ears droop. She's adorable.

“You're good.
But are you open to suggestions?” I ask.
Her ears immediately rise.
“I'd fill these two with something sweet.
For this,” I hold up a croissant, “you can do it before baking.
Just wrap sweet jam or something other in the dough instead of just rolling it up.
As for the other one, you need to do that after baking.

I think it'd be better to change the name of your shop.
Something like ‘Baker Barker's Sweet Shop’ should work.
That way people know you specialize in these goods.
That should help you with getting more customers.

Other than that, I'd like to buy some dough for this. A couple of sheets would do.”

“You know how those were made.”

“Just because I know doesn't mean I can make those.”

“I'm willing to sell these.
I'm also thankful for your input, but making a new sign is…”

“I'll sponsor it,” Luna announces.

Everyone in the room stares at Luna.
I was about to do that but I wouldn't have expected Luna to do the same let alone beat me to it.

“I guess Luna was faster…” I step back and let Luna handle it.

After a while, we leave the bakery.
“I'm surprised you offered to sponsor that place,” Kat speaks what's on my mind.

“Her baking was tasty,” Luna answers.

“I guess she has a new regular now,” I add.

We make our way to Glorindamli's shop.

“Good afternoon, Glorindamli. I heard you asked for me.”

“Hey, Swift!
Yes, Snakkonlir is in town.
I told him about your request.
Though I haven't told him about the new product yet.
He said he already had the items you requested prepared.”

“I see.”

“I still have to tend the shop, so I can only tell you where his stall is set up.
It should be on the plaza next to the Merchants' Guild.”

“I understand. Thanks for going out of your way and notifying me.”

“Don't worry about that. It's not like I'm not looking forward to having some aged ale.”

Everyone present starts laughing.

“Well then, I'm off.”

Kat, Luna and I make our way to the Merchants' Guild.
We find Snakkonlir's stall quite quickly.

“Swift! You came!”

“Hi.
Glorindamli sent a message.
There's some more stuff I want to buy.”

“Let's take care of your order first,” Snak leads to to a storage area, “those casks are all new stock.
I'm giving you those for free.”

“That's very generous of you.”

“It's an investment.
Glorindamli has told me you would have a surprise for me.”

“Oh, I have,” I had him a bottle of Young Maple Ale, the proceeds to taste it.

“This is…”, he starts exclaiming, but I signal him to be quiet, “… I can see why you'd want some casks.
Ageing **that** is much faster.
So what else do you need?”

“With the casks, I have everything I need.
Although… can you prepare the about the same number of empty cask next time?
I think it’d be better to sell you the product in the casks.
I will keep some for myself, of course.”

“That I can arrange.
I know myself transporting a lot of bottles can be a handful.”

“Other than that need something from your regular business.”

“In that case, let’s go back to the front.”

We move back to the front.

“I want to buy some Xitu and Numa.
And I just heard yesterday, you have a tool for making mincemeat.”

“Sure, but…,” he runs to the back again and returns with a manual meat grinder made from a slightly blueish metal, “it’s 300 Tol for everything.”

I give him the money for the goods.
As always, I put those directly into my Infinite Storage.

<h1>Debriefing in Castle Tatilans</h1>
Matt and I enter the castle.

“Prince Matthew, you have a guest,” one servant reports.

“Count Donnell? For an urgent audience, isn't it?” Matt answers.
The servant nods.

“I'll see him. But meeting the king comes first.
Tell him I'll send for him as soon as I'm done with that.”

“Certainly,” the servants leaves.

We enter the throne room.

“Matt, Pat, you have returned,” King Timon greets us.

“I read the preliminary report you sent ahead, Matt.
Considering the information we were given, I fully support your decision.
We'll subsidize their effort to cultivate monster meat and milk.
If it proves successful, we'll spread it to other villages.

However, I'm surprised they didn't mind eating monster meat.
Didn't the late Stirlea oppose that?”

“He did,” Matt answers, “the mayor of the village assured me they were only worried about the side effects of the vaccine.
It's common sense adventurers eat monster meat and they don't experience the effects Stirlea postulated.”

“I see. One last thing, don't you think Stirlea's death was way too convenient?”

“I'm sorry, but I have a sudden guest waiting for me.
This topic needs to be discussed at a later time.
I ask for your understanding.”

“I see. We will discuss it in the future. You may leave.”

Matt and I bow and leave the room.

“We aren't in a hurry, why…”

“Father's intel is good.
Prepare yourself, this is going to be a long evening.”

We enter Matt's office. He sends someone for Count Donnell.
After a few minutes, he enters.
He's a Hume, about half a gross of age.
He looks like the rumours say he looks: his skin covered in some obvious colouring and always in a bad mood.

“Prince Matthew, I'm glad you could make time on such short notice.”

“Think nothing of it, Count Donnell.”

“Before we discuss business, let me congratulate you on the success of your first mission.
I brought some wine for the occasion. Sir Boots, would you kindly get us some cups, please?”

“With pleasure,” I answer.

I get two cups from Matt's cupboard.
Count Donnell pours the wine into the cups.

“I'm sorry,” Matt answers, “but I'm very tired from the trip.
I should abstain from alcohol for today.
Nonetheless I thank you for the gesture.”

“This is nothing. I'm sure you can…”

“Prince Matthew is still tired from the trip,” I interrupt him, “so I will humour you instead.
Cheers!”
I take the cup and take a sip.

Immediately, my throat and stomach are burning.
I spit out everything I haven't swallowed yet.

“What on earth was in the cup?!” I yell.
No, this can't be just strong liquor.
Strong liquor would burn, sure, but it would also subside quite quickly.
But this… I can feel the burning getting stronger.
It must be some kind of fast-acting magical poison!
I mean, I have spit out most of it, and it's still affecting me this much!
I knew there was always the possibility of this happening.
I didn't think someone would actually try this so publicly.

The pain is getting unbearable.
I fall on my floor holding my stomach.
It's getting even hotter!
And it's spreading through my veins.
I can feel my sweat on my skin, but even that feels like it's burning my skin!
My surroundings are fading.
I can hear Matt shouting something.
But I can't understand him anymore.
All I'm left with is this burning sensation throughout my body.

I guess this is it for me.
It was a great time I had with you guys.
I wished I had more time with you…

<h1>Afterword</h1>

<p>
First, thank you for picking up this book!
</p>

<p>
Nice to meet you, this is Thai, also known on the web as 0xReki.
</p>

<p>
I started writing on this on February 1st, 2019.
At that time, I simply wrote down what came to my mind just to notice my story isn't turning out that great.
Plus, I was too inspired by another novel.
It was still distinct, but what I wrote felt too similar.
So on June 11th, 2019, I was left with a choice: continue like that and most likely giving up on writing or repivot.
I chose the latter.
Repivoting is a nice term for “Well, that crappy idea I had didn't work out that well. Let's start over from the beginning with another one.”
</p>

<p>
It turns out having lot's ideas for main story writing one thing but getting ideas for an origin or introductory story is surprisingly hard!
By starting over, I like to think I got a somewhat coherent introduction to everything.
Even if it seems Deus Ex Machina at some points.
Unfortunately, some other ideas had to be scrapped.
And it's unlikely they'll ever make it into Crystal Down.
Maybe they'll make it into another story I might be writing in the future, assuming I still think of it a good concept at that time.
</p>

<p>
I'll spare you the details of the endless technical difficulities. For now.
I might share them with you later.
</p>

<p>
To those readers who have read all the way to the end: thank you so much!
</p>

<p>
I hope to see you again in the next volume.
</p>
