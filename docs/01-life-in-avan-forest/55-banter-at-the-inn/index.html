he answers. “How do I say this… It’s said her emotions can be very intense. Apparently, she gets offended quite easily and tends to pick fights with other adventurers. Though I hear she’s never lost a duel. After seeing her fight, I can imagine why.” “I don’t think she’s a bad person,” I reply, “she’s just somewhat hard to deal with. From our previous meeting in Avan Forest, I reckon she reacts favourably towards an offering of good food.” “You make it sound like she were a higher power,” Matt jokes. “I just don’t know how to deal with her. All I can do is try to get her to leave as soon as possible. At least she’s not accusing me of crimes or yelling other nonsense,” I put on a wry grin. “Please don’t talk about that again,” Kat asks, shaking her head in horror, “I’m still trying to forget those events.” “OK. I won’t,” looks like she can’t forget that horrid scene of the execution, “I’m sorry.” “No, I’m sorry. It’s just too much.” “Anyway, let’s go down, I think they are about to serve dinner. I assume Lecarvi and Sobe will be arriving soon, too. I want to get to know Sobe better before we got with him to Cogen.” “So do I,” Matt answers. I open the door, lead the others downstairs into the hall. There are still some open tables. I walk over to one of them and look at the others. They nod. We sit down. Not soon after, the door opens and I can see Sobe walking in. I wave. He sees us and immediately walks to our table. “Hello again, Sobe. Wasn’t Lecarvi with you?” I ask. “Yes, she was, but she decided to leave town and go westward. She said something about going further south and even staying here making her feeling uneasy,” he sits down, “that’s just how she is. That usually means something exciting will be happening soon. That’s why I want to go there tomorrow. How about you? Are you still planning on going?” “Yes, we are,” Matt answers, “You’re welcome to join us.” “Neat. By the way, have you chosen what to have for dinner? I can recommend the casserole.” “We’ll all have it then!” “I’ll take that as an order then. Seven casseroles for table 4,” the landlady approaches our table. “What do you want to drink? I recommend the mead. We can water it down if it’s too strong.” “I take watered mead,” Kat answers. “Watered mead for me, as well,” Luna adds. “I’ll have watered mead, too,” Pat orders. “I’ll have regular mead,” Matt says. “Watered mead for me,” Sobe asks. “I’ll have watered mead, too,” Silas asks. “I’ll have regular mead.”, I order. So only two of us got regular mead? The landlady brings us our drinks. Matt pays for us. “Cheers,” we clink glasses and drink. It’s tasty. I just love mead. This isn’t as good as the mead I drunk with Suscellu. This one is a tad too sweet, but it’s still good. A few minutes later, the landlady brings us the food. It’s a casserole no doubt. The cheese crust on top has just the perfect level of caramelization. I put a fork into my portion and get a bite. Inside, it’s pasta, meatballs and tomato sauce. “Yes, this is really good!” I praise, “I should be making my special casserole sometime in the future.” “You can cook?” Sobe asks. “Yes, he can,” Matt answers in my stead, “It’s quite a treat.” “Oho? I want to taste it sometime.” “Sure, if you ever drop by my place, I’ll whip something special up for you”, I answer. “But your place means…”, Matt interject. “That just means in the worst case, someone has to guide him,” I answer with a grin. “I see,” Matt answers, “I’m looking forward to it.” “Is your place so hard to find? I don’t think that will ever be a problem. I have a knack for finding things. I’ll just keep looking. In the worst case, I’ll have to ask Matt to guide me,” Sobe is full of confidence. After eating, we go to our rooms. It’s been an exhausting day, so we drop into bed. It’s going to be a long day tomorrow.  " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-hidden> Banter At the Inn </h1> <div class="d-none" id="talkify-title" aria-flowto="talkify-metadata"> <p>0xReki's Adventures by Night<p> <p>Crystal Down 1, Life in Avan Forest, Chapter 55: Banter At the Inn<p> </div> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left"> published on 2020-07-27, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-right"> written by , checked with </small> <div class="clearfix"></div> <small > As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 mt-2"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="⏸&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;▶️" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Who Needs Barrier Crystals?!" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/54-who-needs-barrier-crystals/">Who Needs Barrier Crystals?!</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="The Cheese Crisis Breaks Out" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/56-the-cheese-crisis/">The Cheese Crisis Breaks Out</a> </nav> </header> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>“Silas, I’ve been meaning to ask what you meant by Lecarvi being infamous.”</p> <p>“Oh, you heard that?” he answers. “How do I say this… It’s said her emotions can be very intense. Apparently, she gets offended quite easily and tends to pick fights with other adventurers. Though I hear she’s never lost a duel. After seeing her fight, I can imagine why.”</p> <p>“I don’t think she’s a bad person,” I reply, “she’s just somewhat hard to deal with. From our previous meeting in Avan Forest, I reckon she reacts favourably towards an offering of good food.”</p> <p>“You make it sound like she were a higher power,” Matt jokes.</p> <p>“I just don’t know how to deal with her. All I can do is try to get her to leave as soon as possible. At least she’s not accusing me of crimes or yelling other nonsense,” I put on a wry grin.</p> <p>“Please don’t talk about that again,” Kat asks, shaking her head in horror, “I’m still trying to forget those events.”</p> <p>“OK.
