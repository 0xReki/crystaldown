Tatilans.‚ÄÇThe main house is barely done, but it looks like it‚Äôs livable. The door opens and Alexander and Pat come out to greet me.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs a surprise.‚ÄÇSo this is Alexander‚Äôs new place? ‚ÄúHello, Alexander! Hello, Pat! How did you know I was coming?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt. I was on my way to your place,‚Äù Pat answers, ‚ÄúMatt got Flynn to go with me for this.‚ÄÇSince it‚Äôs on the way, I was just stopping here at Alexander‚Äôs farm for a bit.‚ÄÇThis is where he‚Äôs planning to raise Slimes for the Slime Gelatine production.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs you can see, it‚Äôs not done yet.‚ÄÇBut when it‚Äôs done, I‚Äôd like to get some Slimes from you.‚ÄÇAfter all, I still don‚Äôt know if any Slime will do for that project.‚ÄÇFrom what I know, there‚Äôs the possibility only your Slimes are capable of producing Slime Gelatine.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see. Just take your time building this place.‚ÄÇThe Slimes aren‚Äôt going anywhere!‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇI turn to Pat: ‚ÄúSo what brings you here?‚Äù ‚ÄúMatt needs to go on a smaller trip to the south.‚ÄÇJust a regular inspection of the area.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs still a bit away.‚ÄÇWe figured you might want to join us.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre interested let‚Äôs talk about the details in the palace.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôm interested.‚ÄÇBut before that, I need to drop by Glorindamli‚Äôs place for a bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see, let me accompany you.‚ÄÇAgain, thanks for your hospitality, Alexander.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome. Goodbye!‚Äù ‚ÄúBye!!‚Äù We leave the farm and make our way to Tatilans.‚ÄÇSeeing Pat being with me, the guard lets us enter Tatilans without any checks.‚ÄÇWe continue to go to Glorindamli‚Äôs Armoury. ‚ÄúSay,¬†Pat,¬†have you tried archery yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†it‚Äôs going surprisingly well, I have to say.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a little tricky, but I seem to have the knack for it.‚ÄÇAlso, Lady Aenwyn found some old documents detailing lost Light Magic.‚ÄÇYou use your staff as a bow and shoot light arrows.‚ÄÇI managed to pull it off, but it doesn‚Äôt look like what you used on the Sky Fish.‚Äù ‚ÄúLight arrows?‚ÄÇThat sounds more useful than my Laser spell.‚ÄÇOh,¬†we‚Äôre already here.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait outside.‚Äù I enter. ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Glorindamli!‚Äù ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Swift! It‚Äôs good to see you.‚ÄÇYou have some more pelt?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I do,‚Äù I take out the pelt from my Infinite Storage and hand it to him, ‚Äúbut I need some help, too.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs about‚Ä¶ this,‚Äù I give him the bottle with the young ale. ‚ÄúThe wine? Is there a problem?‚Äù Glorindamli asks. ‚ÄúKind of. Just go ahead and taste it. This a trial run for an improvement,‚Äù I grin. ‚ÄúIf you say so‚Ä¶‚Äù he opens the bottle and takes a sip.‚ÄÇHis eyes open wide.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt Maple Wine. THIS! This is ale! MAPLE ALE! It‚Äôs still young ale but how did you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúShh!‚Äù I try to calm him down, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a secret, for now at least.‚ÄÇI have started a batch, but I need some casks for this.‚Äù Silence. ‚ÄúMy beard‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt pry how you did it‚Ä¶ I see, casks for ageing ale‚Ä¶‚ÄÇUsed casks are no good.‚ÄÇAnd existing residue would change the taste‚Ä¶‚ÄÇSo new casks.‚ÄÇHmm,¬†I‚Äôll source you some casks.‚ÄÇIt might take a while though.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will?!‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†I‚Äôll just push the task onto Snakkonlir.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôll manage it.‚ÄÇHe‚Äôll be the one that‚Äôll profit most, so giving him more work shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Before I forget: that other item Prince Matthew ordered for you is finally done.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe other item?‚Äù ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt he tell you?‚ÄÇWhen he ordered that sleeping bag he also ordered a falconry glove made for you.‚ÄÇIt just look a little longer, since I had to get the right material.‚ÄÇSince it‚Äôs done, let me fit it for you.‚Äù He hands me the glove.‚ÄÇI put it on.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a half glove made from sturdy leather, and it fits quite nicely. ‚ÄúA perfect fit. So I hear you keep a very special bird?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,¬†it‚Äôs just a hawk.‚ÄÇAnd keeping is saying too much.‚ÄÇHe usually lives on his own in the forest.‚ÄÇHe just joins me for hunting and food.‚ÄÇWhen we go hunting he tends to sit on my head, hanging onto my headband.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇThis should do.‚ÄÇDon‚Äôt worry about payment for this.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs already been taken care of.‚ÄÇIf you have trouble with it don‚Äôt hesitate to come here.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll have word sent to you when I hear about the casks.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks for your help. Bye!‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it. Bye!‚Äù Since we‚Äôre done here, Pat and I make our way to Tatilans Castle.‚ÄÇIn Matt‚Äôs room, the others are already waiting for us.‚ÄÇSilas is there as well. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you could make it, Swift.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôre going on a trip?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†our group was tasked with a routine checkup of Cogen, a town three days south of here,‚Äù Luna answers in her usual emotionless manner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs relatively safe, so apart from our party, only Silas will accompany us,‚Äù Kat adds. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs only what‚Äôs on paper,‚Äù Matt adds in a more serious manner.‚ÄÇSilence fills the room.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúThe accounting numbers we received from that town don‚Äôt really add up.‚ÄÇThere might be something fishy happening.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs Silas.‚ÄÇSo I take it we‚Äôre just there for the cover story of a routine checkup and Silas has the real work?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†that‚Äôs basically it,‚Äù Silas answers.‚ÄÇHis answer isn‚Äôt as carefree as I remember him. ‚ÄúIs something amiss, Silas?‚Äù I ask.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 48: Dropping by Glorindamli's Armoury"> Dropping by Glorindamli's Armoury </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-06-22, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/jayfeather#2293" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">jayfeather</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Mortal Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/47-mortal-problems/">Mortal Problems Transcending Realms</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Mail Mirrors and Message Bottles" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/49-mail-mirrors-and-message-bottles/">Mail Mirrors and Message Bottles</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>On my way to Tatilans, I arrive at a farm.‚ÄÇOr rather, this construction site that looks like it‚Äôs going to be a farm.‚ÄÇThis certainly hasn‚Äôt been here the last time I went to Tatilans.‚ÄÇThe main house is barely done, but it looks like it‚Äôs livable.</p> <p>The door opens and Alexander and Pat come out to greet me.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs a surprise.‚ÄÇSo this is Alexander‚Äôs new place?</p> <p>‚ÄúHello, Alexander!

So I hear you keep a very special bird?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúNo,¬†it‚Äôs just a hawk.‚ÄÇAnd keeping is saying too much.‚ÄÇHe usually lives on his own in the forest.‚ÄÇHe just joins me for hunting and food.‚ÄÇWhen we go hunting he tends to sit on my head, hanging onto my headband.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇThis should do.‚ÄÇDon‚Äôt worry about payment for this.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs already been taken care of.‚ÄÇIf you have trouble with it don‚Äôt hesitate to come here.‚ÄÇI‚Äôll have word sent to you when I hear about the casks.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks for your help. Bye!‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it. Bye!‚Äù</p> <p>Since we‚Äôre done here, Pat and I make our way to Tatilans Castle.‚ÄÇIn Matt‚Äôs room, the others are already waiting for us.‚ÄÇSilas is there as well.</p> <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you could make it, Swift.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôre going on a trip?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†our group was tasked with a routine checkup of Cogen, a town three days south of here,‚Äù Luna answers in her usual emotionless manner.</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs relatively safe, so apart from our party, only Silas will accompany us,‚Äù Kat adds.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs only what‚Äôs on paper,‚Äù Matt adds in a more serious manner.‚ÄÇSilence fills the room.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúThe accounting numbers we received from that town don‚Äôt really add up.‚ÄÇThere might be something fishy happening.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs Silas.‚ÄÇSo I take it we‚Äôre just there for the cover story of a routine checkup and Silas has the real work?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†that‚Äôs basically it,‚Äù Silas answers.‚ÄÇHis answer isn‚Äôt as carefree as I remember him.</p> <p>‚ÄúIs something amiss, Silas?‚Äù I ask.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Mortal Problems Transcending Realms" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/47-mortal-problems/">Mortal Problems Transcending Realms</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Mail Mirrors and Message Bottles" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/49-mail-mirrors-and-message-bottles/">Mail Mirrors and Message Bottles</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
