ask. ‚ÄúThe reason for the strained relations?‚Äù Matt finishes my question, ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs not.‚ÄÇIf that was all the relationship would be so much better!‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a problem with their currently most influential religion: the Order of Light, they believe in the deity of Light, Nuh.‚ÄÇJust to clarify, believing in other deities is not the problem.‚ÄÇBut they believe Glanuh is an evil corruption of their god, and they keep demanding us to ban the worship of Glanuh and adopt the worship of Nuh.¬†Furthermore, they see Dark Magic as inherently evil and demand those that have a talent for it to be executed.‚Äù So even in a world where gods openly influence the world, there are conflicts over religion‚Ä¶‚ÄÇThat light sect sounds quite dangerous. ‚ÄúAs far as we know, the Order didn‚Äôt have those extreme views before,‚Äù Alexander continues Matt‚Äôs explanation, ‚Äúthere used to be another denomination in Krale, the Faith of Darkness.‚ÄÇThey worship the Deity of Darkness, Glan.‚ÄÇBoth churches existed without major problems for a long time.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs the denomination we belong to, the Insight of Vision.‚ÄÇBut they are close to nonexistent in Krale.‚ÄÇThere were some scuffles, of course, but according to our intel they never outright declared the other party as evil.‚ÄÇSomething changed when the Order of Light rose to power a few years ago and had the priests and followers of the Faith executed.‚ÄÇLately, things have been strangely tranquil between the countries.‚ÄÇThey say the heir to the Order has gone missing.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo Glan and Nuh.¬†And Glanuh. Sounds like the duality of Light and Darkness,‚Äù I mumble.‚ÄÇWhere did that come from? I can‚Äôt recall ever hearing or reading about that! ‚ÄúDuality? What are you talking about?‚Äù Matt asks. ‚ÄúLight cannot exist without Darkness.‚ÄÇJust as Darkness cannot exist without Light.‚ÄÇIf you look at Light and Darkness close enough, they‚Äôre similar.‚ÄÇMinor details might differ, but it‚Äôs more or less the same.‚ÄÇAlso, you can‚Äôt really choose one over the other.‚ÄÇWe need light to be able to see.‚ÄÇBut we also need darkness to able to see.‚Äù It makes sense, but where am I pulling this knowledge from?‚ÄÇIs that part of my skill in Light and Dark Magic?!‚ÄÇThat last part makes somewhat sense.‚ÄÇWithout the absorption of light, everything would be the same bright white.‚ÄÇThat aside, I‚Äôm interested in Glan and Nuh.‚ÄÇI wonder if my Mystic Eye of Knowledge has some info on them‚Ä¶ Glossary: Glan Glan is one of the two Subordinate Deity to Glanuh and twin to Nuh.‚ÄÇGlan primarily administrates the Night and all aspects of Dark Magic.‚ÄÇTheir symbol is the moon. Glossary: Nuh Nuh is one of the two Subordinate Deity to Glanuh and twin to Glan.‚ÄÇNuh primarily administrates the Day and all aspects of Light Magic.‚ÄÇTheir symbol is the sun. So they are subordinate deities.‚ÄÇI wonder if I‚Äôll ever get to meet them. ‚ÄúBut if Light and Darkness is more or less the same, doesn‚Äôt that mean Light Magic and Dark Magic is similar too?‚Äù Pat asks. Now,¬†my feeling tells me it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs also quite dangerous. ‚ÄúHmm,¬†I haven‚Äôt tried that.‚ÄÇBut now that you mention it, it would make a lot of sense.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd have to do some experiments for that.‚ÄÇBut those are better kept for when fewer people are around.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat makes sense.‚Äù The rain finally stops. We‚Äôre done eating. ‚ÄúThanks for the food! It‚Äôs been great!‚Äù In an endless white room, three people are sitting around a stone table.‚ÄÇThey all wear a worried expression. ‚ÄúSo he has to have gotten used to living in this world,‚Äù the male Hume says. ‚ÄúYes,¬†Taron, that seems to be the case,‚Äù the male Ailuranthrope answers. ‚ÄúStill, what was Flux thinking reincarnating him without any reason?!‚ÄÇSure, it‚Äôs been a while since the last otherworlder.‚ÄÇBut we don‚Äôt particularly need one right now!‚ÄÇAnd then there‚Äôs them giving out skills and traits like that?!‚ÄÇAnd in that number?!‚ÄÇWe‚Äôre lucky this one is so docile!‚Äù the female Neotes sighs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Clayah‚Ä¶ But there is still a problem‚Ä¶‚Äù a robed figured enters.‚ÄÇTheir features are hidden in the robe.‚ÄÇThey take a seat at the table.‚ÄÇThey barely audibly mumble, ‚Äúa divine problem.‚ÄÇWith that many skills‚Ä¶ I foresee it will cross the threshold‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you have noticed him already, Ukota?‚Äù Taron greets the arriving person, ‚Äúhow long do we have?‚ÄÇNot that I particularly care.‚ÄÇBut still, he ought to enjoy his life while he still has it.‚ÄÇI mean, Flux went through the trouble of reincarnating him.‚Äù ‚ÄúAccording to my estimate, several dozen years.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôll take longer if he makes more familiars.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe could suggest him to get some more‚Ä¶‚Äù Clayah answers. ‚ÄúYes,¬†please do that discreetly.‚ÄÇAlso, give him some work to do!‚Äù Taron commands. ‚ÄúAs you wish, Taron.‚ÄÇWhat about something in Suscellu‚Äôs Domain?‚ÄÇThey seem to be a good fit.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think I could say the same about anyone‚Äôs domain.‚ÄÇBut I sure could use a subordinate,‚Äù Suscellu answers. ‚ÄúI did not expect you to agree to this readily.‚ÄÇYou usually reject any candidate I suggest without even thinking about it,‚Äù Taron adds. ‚ÄúI like this one.‚ÄÇThe ones you usually suggest are way too uptight.‚ÄÇI can‚Äôt see them enjoying a good cup of wine.‚Äù ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like drunkards.‚Äù ‚ÄúEnjoying wine doesn‚Äôt mean being a drunkard‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,¬†yes, we‚Äôve had that argument before.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs your domain, so do whatever you want.‚ÄÇSo it shall be.‚Äù ‚ÄúSince that is decided, there one more thing‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 45: Divine Problems Transcending Realms"> Divine Problems Transcending Realms </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata"

It‚Äôs been great!‚Äù</p> <hr /> <p>In an endless white room, three people are sitting around a stone table.‚ÄÇThey all wear a worried expression.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo he has to have gotten used to living in this world,‚Äù the male Hume says.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†Taron, that seems to be the case,‚Äù the male Ailuranthrope answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúStill, what was Flux thinking reincarnating him without any reason?!‚ÄÇSure, it‚Äôs been a while since the last otherworlder.‚ÄÇBut we don‚Äôt particularly need one right now!‚ÄÇAnd then there‚Äôs them giving out skills and traits like that?!‚ÄÇAnd in that number?!‚ÄÇWe‚Äôre lucky this one is so docile!‚Äù the female Neotes sighs.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Clayah‚Ä¶ But there is still a problem‚Ä¶‚Äù a robed figured enters.‚ÄÇTheir features are hidden in the robe.‚ÄÇThey take a seat at the table.‚ÄÇThey barely audibly mumble, ‚Äúa divine problem.‚ÄÇWith that many skills‚Ä¶ I foresee it will cross the threshold‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSo you have noticed him already, Ukota?‚Äù Taron greets the arriving person, ‚Äúhow long do we have?‚ÄÇNot that I particularly care.‚ÄÇBut still, he ought to enjoy his life while he still has it.‚ÄÇI mean, Flux went through the trouble of reincarnating him.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúAccording to my estimate, several dozen years.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôll take longer if he makes more familiars.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWe could suggest him to get some more‚Ä¶‚Äù Clayah answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†please do that discreetly.‚ÄÇAlso, give him some work to do!‚Äù Taron commands.</p> <p>‚ÄúAs you wish, Taron.‚ÄÇWhat about something in Suscellu‚Äôs Domain?‚ÄÇThey seem to be a good fit.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI think I could say the same about anyone‚Äôs domain.‚ÄÇBut I sure could use a subordinate,‚Äù Suscellu answers.</p> <p>‚ÄúI did not expect you to agree to this readily.‚ÄÇYou usually reject any candidate I suggest without even thinking about it,‚Äù Taron adds.</p> <p>‚ÄúI like this one.‚ÄÇThe ones you usually suggest are way too uptight.‚ÄÇI can‚Äôt see them enjoying a good cup of wine.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like drunkards.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúEnjoying wine doesn‚Äôt mean being a drunkard‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYes,¬†yes, we‚Äôve had that argument before.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs your domain, so do whatever you want.‚ÄÇSo it shall be.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSince that is decided, there one more thing‚Ä¶‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" How to Improve on Maple Wine" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/44-how-to-improve-on-maple-wine/">How to Improve on Maple Wine</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Enter Lecarvi the Bard" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/46-lecarvi-the-bard/">Enter Lecarvi the Bard</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free! <br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="author noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site is just a mirror of my Crystal Down Web Novel.
