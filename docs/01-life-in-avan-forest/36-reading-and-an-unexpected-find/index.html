O. C. A. Tion. Invocation. Me.¬†Th.¬†O. D. Method. Invocation Method.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm getting better at reading the characters in this script.‚ÄÇI can already recognize recurring patterns. Sometimes the letters throw me off a little.‚ÄÇSometimes an S looks like a T. I still haven‚Äôt found out the reason why‚Ä¶ If I understand this entry correctly, there are two main invocation methods for magic: Incantations and Short Spells.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve only used Short Spells so far ‚Äî just imagining the effect of the spell and shouting the spell name.‚ÄÇBut it only works if you have an affinity to the type of magic in question. Incantations offset part of the imagining into words to ease casting, but it‚Äôs quite lengthy, so it‚Äôs rarely used.‚ÄÇIncantations can also make up for a lack of affinity to the type of magic in question. Incantations can also be used to cast greater spells in unison with other people.‚ÄÇYou need to have great trust in each other to be able to pull that off, it says.‚ÄÇMaybe we can do that later. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre improving quite fast,‚Äù Patrick says. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúbut it feels to me more like I‚Äôm remembering how to read.‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Patrick leaves and comes back with another book.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs older, but on the cover, I can see it‚Äôs written in Latin Script!‚ÄÇBut I can‚Äôt read it. The language is unlike any language I‚Äôve seen. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúThere are some legends about this book,‚Äù he answers, ‚Äúwould you try to look into it?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I take in and browse through the book.‚ÄÇI find several groups of letters that keep repeating.‚ÄÇIs this book encoded?‚ÄÇI scan for the number of distinct two-letter and three-letter groups.‚ÄÇThis might be encoded with some substitution cipher, maybe just a Caesar Cipher. ‚ÄúI might have a closer look into it sometime in the future.‚ÄÇBut for now, I only have some guesses.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs quite an unusual script, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ancient writing.‚ÄÇBut those are usually carved in stone, not written into paper books.‚ÄÇSome people say it has been left by the previous hero ‚Äî a text written in a way only the next hero can read it,‚Äù Lady Aenwyn answers instead. ‚ÄúWhy would he need to do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs said it details very powerful magic.‚Äù I give decoding it a try. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶‚ÄÇCounting the frequency of that letter with its position is the groups I looked for, this must be an E.‚ÄÇSo these must be T and H.‚ÄÇThis‚Ä¶ could be an I.‚ÄÇSo that might be an N.‚ÄÇBack to the book title: Terran‚Ä¶ Cooking.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a cooking guide for Terran cooking.‚ÄÇIs that for the cooking of my previous life?! This is an unexpected find! ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this details any magic. But can I borrow this?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can keep it if you like,‚Äù Lady Aenwyn says, ‚ÄúI just haven‚Äôt gotten to disposing of it, anyway.‚ÄÇOne of my predecessors spent their whole life researching on it.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never heard what they found out.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no real incentive of decoding that tome anymore.‚ÄÇI think it‚Äôs just a meaningless thing to make people waste time trying to decipher it so they don‚Äôt research greater magic for warfare.‚Äù I finished decoding the title.‚ÄÇIt says: ‚ÄúHow to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with Cratherion Ingredients‚Äù.‚ÄÇIt looks like the previous otherworlder was also fond of cooking.‚ÄÇShould I tell them about it? Let‚Äôs keep it to myself for now.‚ÄÇI should also ask the gods about other otherworlders the next time I see them. ‚ÄúIn that case, thanks, I‚Äôll gladly take it off your hands,‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇI put the book into my Infinite Storage. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt waste too much time decoding it,‚Äù she warns me. I won‚Äôt waste time. It won‚Äôt be a waste of time.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not looking for hidden meanings. What I need is in the text.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-label="Chapter 36: Reading and an Unexpected Find"> Reading and an Unexpected Find </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" class="clearfix" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-02-19, last updated on 2021-06-30 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a>, edited by <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/NotKeoni#1327" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="nofollow">notKeoni</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small style="margin: 4px 0 2px"> As always, a big thanks to all Patrons for their support. </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Slime Jelly Production Talks Before Dinner" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/35-slime-jelly-production-talks-before-dinner/">Slime Jelly Production Talks Before Dinner</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="The Second Day At Tatilans Castle" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/37-the-second-day-at-tatilans-castle/">The Second Day At Tatilans Castle</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="chapter-content"> <!--sse--> <p>The next morning, Patrick leads me to Lady Aenwyn‚Äôs office again.</p> <p>‚ÄúGood morning!‚ÄÇHow was your night?‚Äù Lady Aenwyn greets me.

I still haven‚Äôt found out the reason why‚Ä¶</p> <p>If I understand this entry correctly, there are two main invocation methods for magic: Incantations and Short Spells.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve only used Short Spells so far ‚Äî just imagining the effect of the spell and shouting the spell name.‚ÄÇBut it only works if you have an affinity to the type of magic in question.</p> <p>Incantations offset part of the imagining into words to ease casting, but it‚Äôs quite lengthy, so it‚Äôs rarely used.‚ÄÇIncantations can also make up for a lack of affinity to the type of magic in question.</p> <p>Incantations can also be used to cast greater spells in unison with other people.‚ÄÇYou need to have great trust in each other to be able to pull that off, it says.‚ÄÇMaybe we can do that later.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre improving quite fast,‚Äù Patrick says.</p> <p>‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I answer, ‚Äúbut it feels to me more like I‚Äôm remembering how to read.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Patrick leaves and comes back with another book.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs older, but on the cover, I can see it‚Äôs written in Latin Script!‚ÄÇBut I can‚Äôt read it. The language is unlike any language I‚Äôve seen.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I ask.</p> <p>‚ÄúThere are some legends about this book,‚Äù he answers, ‚Äúwould you try to look into it?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúSure.‚Äù</p> <p>I take in and browse through the book.‚ÄÇI find several groups of letters that keep repeating.‚ÄÇIs this book encoded?‚ÄÇI scan for the number of distinct two-letter and three-letter groups.‚ÄÇThis might be encoded with some substitution cipher, maybe just a Caesar Cipher.</p> <p>‚ÄúI might have a closer look into it sometime in the future.‚ÄÇBut for now, I only have some guesses.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs quite an unusual script, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ancient writing.‚ÄÇBut those are usually carved in stone, not written into paper books.‚ÄÇSome people say it has been left by the previous hero ‚Äî a text written in a way only the next hero can read it,‚Äù Lady Aenwyn answers instead.</p> <p>‚ÄúWhy would he need to do that?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs said it details very powerful magic.‚Äù</p> <p>I give decoding it a try. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶‚ÄÇCounting the frequency of that letter with its position is the groups I looked for, this must be an E.‚ÄÇSo these must be T and H.‚ÄÇThis‚Ä¶ could be an I.‚ÄÇSo that might be an N.‚ÄÇBack to the book title: Terran‚Ä¶ Cooking.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a cooking guide for Terran cooking.‚ÄÇIs that for the cooking of my previous life?! This is an unexpected find!</p> <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this details any magic. But can I borrow this?‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúYou can keep it if you like,‚Äù Lady Aenwyn says, ‚ÄúI just haven‚Äôt gotten to disposing of it, anyway.‚ÄÇOne of my predecessors spent their whole life researching on it.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve never heard what they found out.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no real incentive of decoding that tome anymore.‚ÄÇI think it‚Äôs just a meaningless thing to make people waste time trying to decipher it so they don‚Äôt research greater magic for warfare.‚Äù</p> <p>I finished decoding the title.‚ÄÇIt says: ‚ÄúHow to Replace Terran Cooking Ingredients with Cratherion Ingredients‚Äù.‚ÄÇIt looks like the previous otherworlder was also fond of cooking.‚ÄÇShould I tell them about it? Let‚Äôs keep it to myself for now.‚ÄÇI should also ask the gods about other otherworlders the next time I see them.</p> <p>‚ÄúIn that case, thanks, I‚Äôll gladly take it off your hands,‚Äù I answer.‚ÄÇI put the book into my Infinite Storage.</p> <p>‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt waste too much time decoding it,‚Äù she warns me.</p> <p>I won‚Äôt waste time. It won‚Äôt be a waste of time.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not looking for hidden meanings. What I need is in the text.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Slime Jelly Production Talks Before Dinner" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/35-slime-jelly-production-talks-before-dinner/">Slime Jelly Production Talks Before Dinner</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="The Second Day At Tatilans Castle" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/01-life-in-avan-forest/37-the-second-day-at-tatilans-castle/">The Second Day At Tatilans Castle</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/crystaldown/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
